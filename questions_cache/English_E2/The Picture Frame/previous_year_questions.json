      "question": "Why did Bertha not want Grace to work at Clarkman's bookstore for the summer? What does this tell us about the kind of person she was?",
      "answer": "Bertha didn't want Grace to work at Clarkman's bookstore because she was jealous and selfish. She couldn't bear the thought of Grace earning her own money and becoming independent. This tells us that Bertha was a jealous, possessive, and insecure person who wanted to keep Grace dependent on her so she could feel superior. She pretended to be a good friend but was actually manipulative and envious of Grace.",

      "question": "What did Aunt Margaret write to Bertha to make her want to go to her place for the holidays?",
      "answer": "Aunt Margaret wrote a warm and inviting letter to Bertha, describing the pleasures of spending holidays at her country home. She mentioned the fresh air, beautiful countryside, and peaceful environment that would provide a welcome change from school life. The aunt assured Bertha that though her home was modest, she would be well taken care of with good home-cooked food and comfortable accommodation. She also encouraged Bertha to bring along a school friend to keep her company, showing her generous and hospitable nature. The aunt's letter painted a picture of simple but genuine hospitality, which made Bertha consider the invitation, though she was also looking for more exciting options.",

      "question": "Why was Grace shy with Bertha at first? Do you think Bertha was a good friend? Explain your answer.",
      "answer": "Grace was shy with Bertha at first because of their different social and financial backgrounds. Grace was poor and had lost her mother, wearing mourning clothes, while Bertha came from a more comfortable background. Grace felt inferior and uncertain about how to interact with someone who seemed to have so much more. She was also naturally reserved and didn't want to impose herself on others. However, Bertha was NOT a good friend. Though she appeared friendly on the surface, she was actually jealous, manipulative, and selfish. She deliberately prevented Grace from going to Dovedell Hall because she couldn't bear Grace enjoying luxuries. She also didn't want Grace to work and become independent. A true friend would have been happy for Grace's opportunities rather than secretly sabotaging them.",
