      "question": "1(a) Where did Mr Barton take his daily walks?",

      "question": "1(b) What did Mr Barton think about when the sea was rough?",
      "answer": "When the sea was rough and wild, with huge waves crashing along the shore, Mr Barton feared for the safety of the sailors in their boats far out at sea. This in turn reminded him of the sad or fearful moments in his life. Sometimes he thought of his dear father who had died when he was only four years old. He felt unfortunate that he never really knew that fine old man.",

      "question": "1(c) What was Mr Barton's most treasured possession? Did he have any others?",
      "answer": "Mr Barton's most treasured possession was a large portrait of his father which he treasured more than life itself. Yes, he had other treasured possessions too - a few memories and two faded photographs which his mother had left him. These were kept in a large brown envelope inside a small chest in the corner of the room where he kept his most prized possessions.",

      "question": "1(d) What item caught Mr Barton's eye as he looked at the stall?",
      "answer": "As Mr Barton moved along the length of one table, his attention was drawn to a large mirror. The mirror itself was of little interest to Mr Barton; it was the frame that caught his eye. The frame was truly magnificent, and he thought how well his father's portrait would look in that frame.",

      "id": "tpf_tb_1e",
      "question": "1(e) Why did Mr Barton ask the stallholder what the vase cost?",
      "answer": "Mr Barton asked the stallholder what the vase cost as a clever bargaining tactic. He felt the stallholder's gaze upon him and rather abruptly stopped caressing the frame. He turned his attention to a particularly hideous green and gold plastic flower-vase, picked it up and asked 'How much for this vase?' to distract the stallholder from noticing his real interest in the frame. This way, he could casually ask about the mirror without appearing too interested.",

      "question": "1(f) Why did the stallholder think Mr Barton was a silly old fool?",
      "answer": "The stallholder thought Mr Barton was a silly old fool because he had sold him the old mirror (which he had bought at a junk shop for only two pounds) for twenty pounds. The stallholder said to his wife: 'Some people will buy any old rubbish, especially when you tell them a sad story! Silly old fool, that man.' He believed he had tricked Mr Barton into paying far more than the item was worth by telling him he had fallen on hard times.",

      "question": "1(g) What was painted on the canvas?",
      "answer": "The canvas showed a remarkable scene - an oil painting of a shepherd with his flock resting under the shade of a large oak tree. Far in the distance, there was what looked like a small village, but the details were not clear because the painting was old and covered in grime.",

      "question": "1(h) Why did Mr and Mrs Barton go to the High Street?",
      "answer": "Mr and Mrs Barton went to the High Street to visit an art gallery. They took the mirror and the frame with them, and also carried the portrait of Mr Barton's father and the oil painting. Mrs Barton suggested they could get the portrait of his father put into the frame and have it 'done properly.' They wanted experts to help them frame the portrait professionally.",

      "question": "1(i) Why did they dance?",
      "answer": "Mr and Mrs Barton danced because they were overjoyed when the manager of the art gallery told them that the oil painting was a very famous painting by a very famous artist, worth a very, very large sum of money. They stood and stared at the manager for a long time in disbelief. Then they held each other's hands and danced with joy when they realized the painting found behind the mirror was worth nearly half a million pounds.",

      "answer": "**Mr Barton's Qualities:**\n1. **Kind and compassionate** - When he saw the stallholder had 'fallen on hard times,' he thought 'Poor man. Some people are unluckier than others. I must buy something to help him.'\n2. **Thoughtful and reflective** - During his walks, he would think about happy events and sad moments in his life, his childhood, children, grandchildren, and friends.\n3. **Loving and sentimental** - He treasured his father's portrait 'more than life itself' and kept it carefully in a chest with his most prized possessions.\n4. **Patient and careful** - He worked carefully with a knife to remove the mirror backing 'so as not to damage the frame in any way.'\n5. **Shrewd bargainer** - He pretended to be interested in a hideous vase to distract the stallholder, then negotiated the price down from twenty-three to twenty pounds.\n6. **Appreciative** - He 'looked lovingly at the picture' of his father and 'beamed with pleasure' at simple joys.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Sometimes impulsive** - He bought things that upset his wife ('If you can spend money on an old frame, you can go out and buy your own dinner!').\n2. **Fear of wife's disapproval** - He walked home 'quite afraid of what his wife might say.'\n3. **Obsessive about antiques** - His hobby sometimes caused family tension.",

      "answer": "Mr Barton behaved this way because he did not want the stallholder to know how much he was interested in the frame. If the stallholder saw his enthusiasm, he might raise the price or refuse to negotiate. Mr Barton was a shrewd bargainer - he turned his attention to a hideous plastic flower-vase to pretend he wasn't interested in the frame, so he could get a better price.",

      "answer": "The stallholder was a cunning, dishonest, and opportunistic man. He lied about how much he paid for items to justify higher prices - he claimed to have bought the mirror for more than it was worth when he had actually paid only two pounds for it at a junk shop. He was also unkind and arrogant - after selling the mirror, he called Mr Barton a 'silly old fool' and boasted to his wife about how 'some people will buy any old rubbish, especially when you tell them a sad story!' He pretended to have 'fallen on hard times' to manipulate customers' sympathy.",

He liked nothing better than to take a brisk walk regularly along the seaside, which kept him fit and strong. He was a sentimental man who treasured his father's portrait more than life itself, even though his father had died when he was only four years old. He was passionate about old things and antiques, and was a shrewd bargainer who knew how to negotiate prices.

He lifted it off expecting to see the mirror, but to his surprise he found a sheet of canvas between the wooden back and the mirror. He turned the canvas over and laid it out flat next to the mirror in its frame - and discovered a remarkable oil painting of a shepherd with his flock resting under the shade of a large oak tree.",

He explained that about two hundred years ago, many famous painters had their paintings framed in frames just like this one. He said the frames are very valuable today, but of course, the paintings that were in them are much more valuable. The oil painting, in its original frame, was sold at auction for nearly half a million pounds.",
