        "content": "The story 'The Picture Frame' by Nicholas Horsburgh is about Mr Barton, an eighty-two-year-old retired man who lives with his wife in a small seaside town in England. He loves taking daily walks by the sea, which remind him of both happy and sad memories from his life.\n\nOne day, while walking, Mr Barton comes across a stall where a man is selling personal items to raise money. Among the items, Mr Barton notices an ornate mirror frame that catches his eye. He thinks it would be perfect for the portrait of his late father, whom he lost when he was only four years old.\n\nAfter some bargaining, Mr Barton buys the mirror for twenty pounds (the stallholder had bought it for just two pounds). When he shows it to his wife, she becomes angry about the expense and storms off to bed.\n\nLater, Mr Barton decides to examine the frame. Using a knife, he removes the wooden back and discovers a hidden oil painting of a shepherd with his flock under an oak tree. He sets it aside to place his father's portrait in the frame.\n\nThe next day, unable to find the stallholder to return the mirror, Mr Barton and his wife go to an art gallery on the high street. The manager examines the frame and the hidden painting, and excitedly reveals that it is a very famous, valuable painting by a renowned artist.\n\nIn the end, the portrait of Mr Barton's father hangs proudly in his study, and the discovered oil painting is sold at auction for nearly half a million pounds. Mr and Mrs Barton dance with joy at their unexpected fortune."
