      "id": "tpf_sa_7",
      "question": "Why do you think the stallholder sold the frame so cheaply?",
      "answer": "The stallholder sold the frame cheaply because he had no idea that a valuable painting was hidden behind the mirror. He only saw a scratched frame with a dirty, cracked mirror and thought twenty pounds was a good profit since he had paid only two pounds for it. His ignorance of the hidden treasure cost him a fortune.",
      "justification": "The stallholder's lack of knowledge about the painting's existence explains his pricing."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_sa_8",

      "answer": "Several qualities helped Mr. Barton make this discovery. His passion for antiques made him notice the ornate frame. His patience in searching for treasures led him to that stall.

      "question": "What is the significance of the title 'The Picture Frame'?",
      "answer": "The title 'The Picture Frame' is significant because the story centres around an old picture frame that Mr. Barton buys.

      "question": "How does the story demonstrate the saying 'appearances can be deceiving'?",
      "answer": "The story perfectly demonstrates this saying through the picture frame itself. Outwardly, it appeared to be just a scratched old frame with a dirty, cracked mirror - something of little value. However, hidden beneath this unappealing exterior was a masterpiece worth half a million pounds. Similarly, the stallholder appeared knowledgeable about his merchandise but was actually ignorant of its true value.",
      "justification": "The contrast between appearance and reality is a central theme of the story."

      "justification": "The defects are mentioned during the bargaining scene."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_sa_13",
      "question": "How much did the stallholder claim he paid for the frame, and how much did he actually pay?",
      "answer": "The stallholder claimed he had paid ten pounds for the frame to justify his asking price of forty pounds. However, he had actually paid only two pounds for it. This lie was meant to make Mr. Barton feel he was getting a fair deal, but the stallholder's dishonesty ultimately didn't help him since he missed out on the hidden treasure.",
      "justification": "The difference between claimed and actual cost shows the stallholder's dishonesty."

    {
      "id": "tpf_sa_16",
      "question": "What was Mr. Barton's reaction when he heard the painting's value?",
      "answer": "Mr. Barton was stunned and in disbelief when he heard the painting's value.

      "justification": "This vocabulary word from the story means a very large number."
    },
    {

      "question": "How did Mr. Barton's bargaining skills help him?",
      "answer": "Mr. Barton's bargaining skills helped him get the frame at half the asking price.

      "question": "Why is it important to examine things carefully before judging their value?",
      "answer": "The story teaches us that careful examination is important because true value may be hidden from view. The stallholder judged the frame only by its surface appearance and missed the valuable painting behind the mirror. Mr. Barton, by carefully cleaning and examining his purchase, discovered the hidden treasure. This shows that patience and thoroughness can reveal unexpected value.",
      "justification": "This moral lesson emerges from the contrast between the two characters' approaches."
    },

      "question": "How did Mr. Barton's age affect his approach to antique hunting?",

      "question": "What might have happened to the painting if someone else had bought the frame?",
      "answer": "If someone else had bought the frame, the painting might have remained hidden forever or been destroyed. A less careful person might have thrown away the old frame or not bothered to clean it properly. Someone focused only on the mirror might have never discovered the painting behind it. Mr. Barton's careful treatment of his antiques saved this masterpiece from being lost.",
      "justification": "This speculative question explores alternative outcomes."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_sa_26",
      "question": "Why do you think someone hid the painting behind the mirror?",
      "answer": "Someone might have hidden the painting behind the mirror for several reasons. Perhaps they wanted to protect it during wartime or political unrest. They might have been trying to smuggle it across borders or hide it from thieves. It's also possible that the original owner died before revealing the secret, and subsequent owners never knew about the hidden treasure.",

    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_sa_27",
      "question": "How would the stallholder have felt when he learned about the painting's true value?",
      "answer": "The stallholder would have felt devastated, shocked, and deeply regretful when he learned about the painting's true value. He had sold a painting worth half a million pounds for just twenty pounds, making a profit of only eighteen pounds when he could have been rich. His failure to examine his merchandise properly cost him a fortune, and his dishonesty about the purchase price would seem even more foolish.",
      "justification": "This question explores the stallholder's likely emotional response."
    },

      "answer": "The word 'hideous' means extremely ugly or unpleasant to look at. In the story, one might describe how the dirty, cracked mirror looked hideous before Mr. Barton cleaned it. Example from everyday life: The abandoned building with broken windows and graffiti looked hideous and frightened the children walking past it.",
      "justification": "This vocabulary word describes something extremely unattractive."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_sa_30",
      "question": "How does this story show that honesty is important?",
      "answer": "The story shows the importance of honesty through the stallholder's fate. He lied about paying ten pounds for the frame when he had actually paid only two pounds. Despite his dishonesty, he didn't benefit - in fact, he lost enormously by selling a painting worth half a million pounds. Meanwhile, honest Mr. Barton, who genuinely loved antiques, was rewarded with a fortune.",
      "justification": "The moral lesson about honesty emerges from the stallholder's experience."
    },

      "question": "What role does luck play in the story?",

Luck favoured him because he was prepared to receive it.",
      "justification": "This explores the balance between luck and preparation in the story."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_sa_33",
      "question": "How does the story illustrate the saying 'one man's trash is another man's treasure'?",
      "answer": "The story perfectly illustrates this saying through the picture frame. To the stallholder, it was just a scratched old frame with a cracked mirror - essentially trash worth only a small profit. To Mr. Barton, it was a potential treasure worth investigating. In the end, what the stallholder considered nearly worthless turned out to be worth half a million pounds - a literal treasure hidden in seeming trash.",
      "justification": "This proverb directly relates to the story's central plot."
    },

      "id": "tpf_sa_34",
      "question": "What can we learn about the value of expertise from this story?",
      "answer": "The story teaches that expertise and knowledge are valuable. Mr. Barton's expertise in antiques helped him spot the ornate frame's potential. The art gallery expert's expertise revealed the painting's true value of half a million pounds. In contrast, the stallholder's lack of expertise in examining his goods cost him dearly. Knowledge and skill in one's field can lead to recognizing opportunities others miss.",
      "justification": "The role of expertise is evident in both Mr. Barton's and the expert's actions."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_sa_35",
      "question": "Describe the setting of the story.",
      "answer": "The story is set in a seaside town in England. Mr. Barton wanders through the town's market stalls and shop windows during his morning walks. The key locations include the market stall where he buys the frame, his home where he cleans it and discovers the painting, and the art gallery in London where he gets the painting evaluated. The coastal English setting adds charm to the narrative.",
      "justification": "The setting establishes the story's English seaside atmosphere."
