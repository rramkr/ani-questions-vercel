His ignorance of the hidden treasure cost him a fortune.",
      "justification": "The stallholder's lack of knowledge about the painting's existence explains his pricing."

      "question": "What is the significance of the title 'The Picture Frame'?",
      "answer": "The title 'The Picture Frame' is significant because the story centres around an old picture frame that Mr. Barton buys. The frame appears ordinary but contains an extraordinary secret - a valuable painting hidden behind a mirror. The title draws attention to how something seemingly insignificant can hold great value, and how true treasures may be concealed in unexpected places.",
      "justification": "The title emphasizes the central object around which the plot revolves."

      "id": "tpf_sa_10",
      "question": "How does the story demonstrate the saying 'appearances can be deceiving'?",
      "answer": "The story perfectly demonstrates this saying through the picture frame itself. Outwardly, it appeared to be just a scratched old frame with a dirty, cracked mirror - something of little value. However, hidden beneath this unappealing exterior was a masterpiece worth half a million pounds. Similarly, the stallholder appeared knowledgeable about his merchandise but was actually ignorant of its true value.",
      "justification": "The contrast between appearance and reality is a central theme of the story."
