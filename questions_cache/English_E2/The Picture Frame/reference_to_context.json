This reminded him of the sad or fearful moments in his own life.\n\n(ii) The author shows Mr Barton was kind and thoughtful because he worried about the safety of sailors at sea when the waves were rough. He cared about others' wellbeing, even strangers he had never met.\n\n(iii) 'This in turn' suggests a cause-and-effect relationship.

He had only a few memories and two faded photographs that his mother had left him to remember his father by.\n\n(ii) Mr Barton felt unfortunate because his father died when he was only four years old, so he never really got to know that fine old man. He missed the opportunity to build a relationship with his father.\n\n(iii) 'Faded photographs' suggests that many years have passed since his father's death.

      "answer": "(i) 'Treasured more than life itself' means valued extremely highly, loved more than anything else in the world. Mr Barton loved the portrait of his father beyond measure.\n\n(ii) The portrait was precious because it was the only large image of his father that he had. Since his father died when he was four, this portrait was his main connection to knowing what his father looked like and who he was.\n\n(iii) This tells us that despite barely knowing his father, Mr Barton had deep love and reverence for him.

Mr Barton had saved money from his hard work for retirement.\n\n(ii) 'Little left to afford any luxuries' means after buying necessities, they had very little extra money for unnecessary or indulgent purchases. They lived within their means without extras.\n\n(iii) This information is important because it explains why Mr Barton hesitated to buy the frame and why his wife got angry about the purchase.

He felt sympathy for the stallholder and wanted to help him by buying something, even though he himself didn't have much extra money.\n\n(iii) The irony is that the stallholder was not truly in hard times - he was lying to get sympathy and higher prices.

They had limited money for luxuries, and she might see this purchase as wasteful.\n\n(iii) This shows that Mrs Barton was practical and perhaps strict about money matters. Mr Barton respected her opinion and was slightly afraid of her disapproval. Despite being 82 years old, he still worried about getting 'into trouble' with his wife like a child might.",

      "answer": "(i) 'Hideous' means very ugly. Mr Barton asked about the ugly vase to distract the stallholder from noticing his interest in the frame - a clever bargaining tactic.\n\n(ii) 'Ghastly' also means very ugly or unpleasant. The author uses both 'hideous' and 'ghastly' to emphasize how unattractive the vase was.\n\n(iii) Mr Barton was using misdirection as a bargaining tactic. By showing interest in a cheap, ugly item first, he hoped to make the stallholder think he wasn't particularly interested in the expensive frame.

Why or why not?",
      "answer": "(i) The stallholder is described as 'no fool' because he had noticed Mr Barton's interest in the frame from the beginning. He wasn't fooled by the vase trick and understood that Mr Barton really wanted the mirror/frame.\n\n(ii) 'Casually' suggests that Mr Barton was trying to appear uninterested or indifferent about the mirror. He was attempting to hide his true desire for it so he could negotiate a better price.\n\n(iii) Mr Barton's tactic did not fully work because the stallholder had already noticed his interest. However, through further negotiation, Mr Barton did manage to get the price reduced from twenty-three pounds to twenty pounds.",

      "answer": "(i) No, Mr Barton was only pretending to be surprised. This was part of his bargaining strategy to make the stallholder think the price was too high so he would reduce it.\n\n(ii) 'Stepping back in horror' was an exaggerated physical reaction to emphasize his shock at the price. It was part of his performance to convince the stallholder that the asking price was unreasonable.\n\n(iii) Mr Barton was using the technique of expressing shock or dismay at the initial price. This is a common bargaining method where the buyer acts as if the price is outrageous, hoping the seller will lower it to make a sale.",

He had lied about falling on hard times to gain sympathy and get higher prices. He was actually doing very well financially through his deceptive practices.\n\n(iii) This creates irony because the stallholder thinks he has cleverly cheated Mr Barton.

He believed people were gullible and easily fooled, especially when given a sympathetic story.\n\n(iii) Calling Mr Barton a 'silly old fool' is deeply ironic because Mr Barton will discover a painting worth nearly half a million pounds hidden in the frame.
