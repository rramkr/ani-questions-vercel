      "question": "Summary of The Picture Frame (Nicholas Horsburgh)",
      "answer": "The story is about Mr Barton, an eighty-two-year-old retired man who lives with his wife in a small seaside town in England. He enjoys taking daily walks by the sea, which remind him of both happy and sad memories - particularly of his father, who died when Mr Barton was only four years old.\n\nOne day, Mr Barton finds a stall where a man is selling items. He notices an ornate mirror frame and buys it for twenty pounds, thinking it would be perfect for his father's portrait.\n\nHis wife is angry about the expense. That evening, Mr Barton examines the frame and discovers a hidden oil painting behind the mirror - a shepherd with his flock under an oak tree.\n\nThey take it to an art gallery, where the manager reveals it is a famous, valuable painting. The painting is sold at auction for nearly half a million pounds, while the stallholder boasts about fooling 'a silly old man' - unaware that he lost a fortune."
