      "question": "Summary of The Shree Krishna Eating House (Anita Desai)",
      "answer": "This excerpt is from the novel 'The Village by the Sea' by Anita Desai. We are introduced to Hari, a young boy from Thul who has found himself alone in Mumbai and working in a makeshift restaurant called the Sri Krishna Eating House.\n\nThis restaurant caters primarily to the city's outliers – the beggars, the hard labourers and the underprivileged who could just about afford a meal.\n\nThe eating house is described vividly, from its grimy appearance to its abysmal conditions, where the ceiling is obscured by cobwebs and soot and where lentil curry and chapattis are cooked over open stoves.\n\nWhen Hari offers to work in exchange for food, the owner agrees. During his work, Hari faces language barriers with his Tamil-speaking co-workers. He befriends the old watchmaker next door, who helps him write to his family.\n\nThis chapter shows Hari grappling with his new harsh reality, but finding hope through the friendships he builds in this chaotic city."
