      "question": "Describe the physical condition of the Sri Krishna Eating House.",
      "answer": "The Sri Krishna Eating House was the meanest and shabbiest restaurant Hari had ever seen.

      "answer": "The main customers were the city's outliers - beggars, coolies who carried heavy loads like sacks of coal and gas cylinders, and cart-pullers.

They also came because the restaurant was open at all hours to serve people with irregular work schedules.",

      "answer": "When Hari realized he had no money to pay for the food Jagu was giving him, he offered to work in the kitchen instead.

      "question": "What language barrier did Hari face at work?",

      "question": "Why couldn't the owner maintain the eating house properly?",
      "answer": "The owner, Jagu, couldn't maintain the eating house because he was overworked and had neither the time nor the money to clean or decorate the place.
