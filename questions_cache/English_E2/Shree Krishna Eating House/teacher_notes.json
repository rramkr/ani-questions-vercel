      "question": "What is the story 'The Shree Krishna Eating House' about? Give a brief summary.",
      "answer": "In this excerpt from the novel 'The Village by the Sea' by Anita Desai, we are introduced to Hari, a young boy from Thul who has found himself alone in Mumbai and working in a makeshift restaurant called the Sri Krishna Eating House.\n\nThis restaurant caters primarily to the city's outliers - the beggars, the hard labourers and the underprivileged who could just about afford a meal.\n\nThe eating house is described vividly, from its grimy appearance to its abysmal conditions, where the ceiling is obscured by cobwebs and soot and where lentil curry and chapattis are cooked over open stoves.\n\nIts owner, despite retaining two young boys as unpaid help, is overworked and has neither the time nor the money to maintain or decorate the place."
