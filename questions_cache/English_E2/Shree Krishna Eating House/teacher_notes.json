        "content": "In this excerpt from the novel 'The Village by the Sea' by Anita Desai, we are introduced to Hari, a young boy from Thul who has found himself alone in Mumbai and working in a makeshift restaurant called the Sri Krishna Eating House. This restaurant caters primarily to the city's outliers - the beggars, the hard labourers and the underprivileged who could just about afford a meal.\n\nThe eating house is described vividly, from its grimy appearance to its abysmal conditions, where the ceiling is obscured by cobwebs and soot and where lentil curry and chapattis are cooked over open stoves. Its owner, despite retaining two young boys as unpaid help, is overworked and has neither the time nor the money to maintain or decorate the place.\n\nWhen Hari awakens and grasps the reality of his surroundings, he offers to work in exchange for food, and the owner agrees."

        "content": "During the course of his work, Hari realises the difficulty in communicating with his co-workers who speak only Tamil. Notwithstanding the language barrier, a camaraderie forms through the shared hardship of their tasks - kneading dough, baking chapattis and serving customers in stifling heat without respite or conversation.\n\nA friendship brews between Hari and the old watchmaker next door, who runs a shop named Ding Dong Watch Works. This gentleman appears kind and open-minded, reminding Hari of a man he met at a meeting in his village. Through conversations with the watchmaker, Hari learns about the tragic past of his co-workers, whose parents were killed in a railway accident. The watchmaker also helps him locate the post office and lends him money to buy a postcard to write to his family, indicating his decision to stay in Mumbai."
