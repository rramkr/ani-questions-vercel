      "question": "Reference to Context: 'I have no money to pay for all this food you are giving me. Will you let me work in your kitchen instead?'\n\n(i) Who said these words and to whom was he speaking?\n(ii) What was the restaurant called? In which city was it located?\n(iii) Why did the owner agree to this request? What work was the speaker asked to do?\n(iv) Apart from the speaker, who else worked there and why could they not become friends?\n(v) Why was the restaurant in such a dilapidated state?",
      "answer": "(i) Hari said these words to Jagu, the owner of the Sri Krishna Eating House. Hari had just arrived in Bombay and was given food without asking for it, but he felt uncomfortable taking it for free.\n\n(ii) The restaurant was called the Sri Krishna Eating House. It was located in Bombay (Mumbai), in a busy commercial area of the city.\n\n(iii) Jagu agreed because he could use another boy in the kitchen. Hari was asked to wash pots, knead the dough, and help roll out the chapatis. In return, he would get his meals and one rupee a day.\n\n(iv) Apart from Hari, two Tamil boys worked there. They could not become friends because of a language barrier - the Tamil boys only spoke Tamil, while Hari knew Hindi and Marathi. Also, the boys were too tired and sad to speak.\n\n(v) The restaurant was in a dilapidated state because it was the cheapest restaurant in Bombay, catering to the poorest customers like beggars and coolies. The open stoves created soot that covered everything, and there was no money for decorations or maintenance.",

      "question": "Reference to Context: 'He is a silent man, never speaks to anyone--- but he has been good to many. Like those two boys who work for him'\n\n(i) Who said these words and to whom were they spoken?\n(ii) Where were the two of them working?\n(iii) Who was the speaker talking about? How had he helped the two boys?\n(iv) What were the boys given beside money? Why were the three boys unable to talk to each other?\n(v) Name the book this excerpt is taken from and the author.",
      "answer": "(i) The old watchmaker from Ding Dong Watchworks said these words to Hari. He was telling Hari about Jagu, the owner of the eating house.\n\n(ii) The two of them (the watchmaker and Hari) were working next door to each other - the watchmaker at his watch repair shop called Ding Dong Watchworks, and Hari at the Sri Krishna Eating House.\n\n(iii) The speaker was talking about Jagu, the owner of the eating house. Jagu had helped the two Tamil boys by taking them in after their parents were killed in a railway accident. He found them homeless and brought them to work at his restaurant.\n\n(iv) Besides money (one rupee a day), the boys were given food and shelter. The three boys could not talk to each other because of the language barrier - Hari spoke Hindi and Marathi while the Tamil boys only spoke Tamil.\n\n(v) This excerpt is taken from 'The Village by the Sea' written by Anita Desai.",

      "question": "Reference to Context: 'He worked hard himself all day and had two boys to help him knead the dough in huge pans, roll out the chapatis and bake them over open fires which they kept lit day and night.'\n\n(i) Who was 'he'? What did he own and where was it?\n(ii) How had the two boys come to work for him?\n(iii) Who was the new boy who joined them and why could they not become friends?\n(iv) What work did the new boy have to do and what all would he get in return?\n(v) What kind of customers did this place attract and why did they go there?",
      "answer": "(i) 'He' refers to Jagu, the owner of the Sri Krishna Eating House. He owned a small, shabby restaurant located in Bombay. It was the cheapest eating place in the city.\n\n(ii) The two boys were Tamil orphans. Their father worked for the railways and they lived on a platform. One day, a train ran over their parents while they were crossing the line to fetch water. Jagu found them homeless one morning while coming to work and brought them to the eating house.\n\n(iii) The new boy was Hari, who had come from the village of Thul. They could not become friends because of a language barrier - Hari spoke Hindi and Marathi while the two boys only spoke Tamil. Also, the boys were too tired and sad to talk.\n\n(iv) Hari had to wash pots, knead the dough, and help roll out chapatis. In return, he would get his meals and one rupee a day, the same as the other boys.\n\n(v) The customers were beggars, coolies who carried loads like coal sacks and gas cylinders, and cart-pullers who dragged goods on hand-drawn carts. They came there because it was the cheapest restaurant in Bombay - even a beggar could afford a meal.",

      "question": "What drew Hari to the owner of the Watchworks? How did the old man help him?",
      "answer": "Hari was drawn to the old watchmaker because he looked very similar to Sayyid Ali, a respected man who had spoken well at a meeting by the Black Horse in his village Thul. This resemblance made Hari feel he could trust the watchmaker. The old man helped Hari in several ways - he told him where the post office was so he could send a letter to his mother, he lent Hari money to buy a postcard, and he also lent him a ballpoint pen to write with.",

The kind watchman had brought him to the eating house where he was given food and allowed to sleep. The next morning, Hari observed that the restaurant was extremely dirty and dilapidated - the meanest and shabbiest he had ever seen. The walls were covered in grime and soot, the ceiling had cobwebs that looked like a furry blanket, and the floor and tables were black from the soot of open stoves.",

Hari was drawn to him because he reminded him of Sayyid Ali, a respected man from his village Thul who had spoken impressively at a meeting. This resemblance made Hari feel he could trust him.

      "question": "Why didn't the two boys in the kitchen speak to Hari? What kind of work did Hari have to do there?",
      "answer": "The two Tamil boys in the kitchen did not speak to Hari for two reasons. First, there was a language barrier - they only spoke Tamil while Hari knew Hindi and Marathi. Second, they were too tired and too sad to speak - they were orphans whose parents had died in a railway accident, and they worked so hard in such heat that no one had the strength to talk. Hari had to wash pots, knead the dough in huge pans, and help roll out chapatis that were baked over open fires kept lit day and night.",

      "answer": "Jagu was a hardworking and compassionate man. He was hardworking because he worked himself all day at the eating house, cooking, serving customers, and managing everything with barely any rest. He was compassionate because he helped those in need without expecting anything - he gave Hari food and a job when he had nothing, and he took in the two orphaned Tamil boys whose parents were killed in a railway accident. The watchmaker described him as 'a silent man but good to many,' which shows his kindness was expressed through actions rather than words.",

      "answer": "Hari left his village Thul and came to Bombay to find work and earn money for his family. His family consisted of his mother, father, and sisters. Hari needed to look after his family because his mother was very ill and his father was drunk most of the time and could not be depended upon.

      "question": "Describe how the two boys had come to work for Jagu. What did the owner of the Watchworks have to say about Jagu?",
      "answer": "The two Tamil boys who worked at the Sri Krishna Eating House were orphans with a tragic background. Their father had worked for the railways, and the family lived on a railway platform because they had no proper home. One terrible day, both their parents were killed when a train ran over them as they were crossing the railway line to fetch water from a pump. The boys were left homeless and helpless. Jagu found these orphaned boys one morning while coming to work. He did not ignore them but brought them straight to the eating house and gave them food, shelter, and work.\n\nThe old watchmaker from Ding Dong Watchworks, who worked next door, spoke highly of Jagu to Hari. He said, 'He is a silent man, never speaks to anyone - but he has been good to many.' The watchmaker explained that despite being quiet and always busy, Jagu had a kind heart and helped those in need. He pointed out how Jagu had taken in the two orphaned Tamil boys without hesitation, providing them with a means to survive. This showed that Jagu was a man of few words but many good deeds.",

      "question": "Describe The Shree Krishna Eating House and compare it with restaurants in Thul. What kind of people came to eat there and why?",
      "answer": "The Sri Krishna Eating House was the meanest and shabbiest restaurant Hari had ever seen. It had no decorations whatsoever - not even a simple coloured picture of Lord Krishna, after whom it was named. The walls were covered in grime and soot, and the ceiling had so many cobwebs that it looked like a furry blanket. The floor and all the wooden tables were black from the soot that came from the open stoves where food was cooked day and night. Even the simple cafes in Hari's village Thul were cleaner and nicer than this place.\n\nIn contrast, the restaurants in Thul, though simple, were much more pleasant. They had basic decorations and were not covered in layers of dirt and soot. The atmosphere was more welcoming compared to the grimy, dark interior of the Sri Krishna Eating House.\n\nThe customers who came to the eating house were the city's poorest workers - beggars who had no regular income, coolies who carried heavy loads like sacks of coal and gas cylinders on their backs, and cart-pullers who dragged goods through the city on hand-drawn wooden carts. They came there because it was the cheapest restaurant in Bombay - even a beggar could afford to buy himself a meal. The food was basic (dal and chapatis) but affordable, and the restaurant was always open to serve people who worked irregular hours.",

      "question": "Describe the Shree Krishna Eating House. How was it different from the restaurants in Thul?",
      "answer": "The Sri Krishna Eating House was the meanest and shabbiest restaurant Hari had ever seen in his life. Despite being named after Lord Krishna, it had no picture of the deity on its walls - in fact, any picture that might have been there had long since disappeared under layers of grime and soot. The walls were covered in thick grime, and the ceiling had so many cobwebs that it looked like a furry grey blanket hanging overhead. The floor and all the wooden tables were completely black from the soot that came from the open stoves where food was cooked continuously, day and night.\n\nThe restaurant was extremely basic - there were no decorations, no comforts, just the bare essentials for cooking and serving food. The open stoves filled the small space with smoke and soot, coating everything in a layer of black residue. It was certainly the cheapest restaurant anyone could find in Bombay, which is why even beggars could afford to eat there.\n\nIn comparison, the restaurants in Hari's village Thul were much nicer. Even the simplest cafes in Thul had basic decorations, were kept reasonably clean, and had a more pleasant atmosphere. They may have been simple, but they were not covered in layers of accumulated dirt, soot, and cobwebs like the Sri Krishna Eating House. The difference showed how harsh city life could be for the poorest people.",
