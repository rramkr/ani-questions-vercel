      "question": "1(a) In what ways was the Sri Krishna Eating House different from the restaurants in Thul?",
      "answer": "The Sri Krishna Eating House was the meanest and shabbiest restaurant Hari had ever seen. In contrast, the cafes in Thul were pleasanter - they were usually wooden shacks built in the shade of a mango or frangipani tree, with a handful of marigolds and hibiscus crammed into an old ink bottle for a vase, coloured bottles of aerated drinks attractively arranged on the shelves, and possibly a bright picture of a god or goddess on the wall with a tinsel garland around the frame and heavily scented joss sticks burning before it. The Sri Krishna Eating House did not have even so much as a coloured picture of Krishna glued to the wall - just layers of grime and soot covering the walls, cobwebs on the ceiling that trapped soot making it look like a furry blanket, and black floors and tables from soot.",

      "question": "1(b) What kind of people came to eat at the Sri Krishna Eating House? Why did they come to this particular restaurant?",
      "answer": "The customers were beggars and coolies who had stopped in between carrying their loads - sacks of coal and cylinders of gas - and cart-pullers who dragged goods through the city on long wooden hand-drawn carts. These people seemed to have no fixed working hours - before daylight there were some waiting for a meal who were given the leftovers of the night before, and the last came in after midnight when the whole city seemed to collapse into exhausted, disturbed sleep. They came to this particular restaurant because it was certainly the cheapest restaurant anyone could possibly find in Bombay - even a beggar could afford to buy himself a meal here.",

      "question": "1(c) Why was the restaurant in such a dilapidated condition?",
      "answer": "The restaurant was in a dilapidated condition because the owner had no time to sweep or clean it and no money to decorate it with pictures and flowers. He worked hard himself all day and had two boys to help him knead the dough in huge pans, roll out the chapatis and bake them over open fires which they kept lit day and night. The customers came at all hours - some before daylight for leftovers of the night before, and some after midnight - so there was never any time for maintenance or cleaning.",

      "question": "1(d) Why did the two boys in the kitchen not speak to Hari?",
      "answer": "The two boys did not speak to Hari because they spoke only Tamil, a language Hari did not know. When the boys finally did say something to each other, Hari realized it was in Tamil, a language he did not know. Nor did they seem to know any Hindi or Marathi, the two languages Hari knew. So there was silence between them. They were in any case neither friendly nor inquisitive about him, or else they were simply too tired and too sad to speak.",

      "question": "1(e) Why did Hari like talking to the old man in the watch shop?",
      "answer": "Hari liked talking to the old watchmaker because the man proved to be friendly. The old man looked so much like Sayyid Ali, the man who had spoken so well at the meeting by the Black Horse in Thul, that Hari instantly felt here was another fine and impressive man whom he could trust and who would understand him and try to help him. The watchmaker smiled at Hari, showed interest in him by asking questions, and helped him by telling him where the post office was and offering to lend him money for a postcard.",

      "question": "1(f) What does the phrase 'stared open-mouthed' suggest?",
      "answer": "The phrase 'stared open-mouthed' suggests that Hari was amazed and astonished. He stood on the pavement staring open-mouthed at all the clocks that hung tick-tocking on the walls and the watches that glittered in the showcases. Coming from a small village like Thul, he had never seen so many timepieces in one place, and it filled him with wonder and fascination. The phrase indicates complete surprise and awe.",

      "id": "skeh_tb_1g",
      "question": "1(g) Why was the owner of the watch shop 'more likely' to have a pen?",
      "answer": "The watchmaker was more likely to have a pen than the owner of the eating house because he was an educated man who ran a technical repair business. He needed to write receipts, make notes about watch repairs, and keep records. The story says Hari 'returned to the watchmaker who seemed more likely to have one than the owner of the eating house.' In contrast, Jagu, the eating house owner, was too busy with manual work - cooking, kneading dough, and serving customers - and there was no one in the shop during the sweltering afternoon when even the two orphans had fallen asleep under the table from heat and exhaustion.",

      "question": "(HOTS) 1(h) What made Hari both frightened and happy? What other feelings might he be experiencing? Why?",
      "answer": "Hari felt both happy and frightened when he wrote the postcard to his mother. He was happy because he had done what he knew he should do - inform his family that he was safe and had found work. He felt he had fulfilled his duty to let his mother know where he was.\n\nHe was frightened because sending the postcard meant he would be staying on in Bombay, not going home. It made his decision to leave permanent and real.\n\n**Other feelings he might be experiencing:**\n- **Loneliness** - being far from family in a strange city\n- **Anxiety** - about his sick mother and drunk father back home\n- **Pride** - in finding work and being independent\n- **Guilt** - for leaving his sisters to cope alone\n- **Hope** - that he could earn money to help his family\n- **Determination** - to succeed despite the difficult circumstances\n- **Homesickness** - missing his village Thul and his family",

      "question": "(HOTS) 1(i) In what ways was Jagu, the owner of the shop, kind? What do you think of the way he treated the boys who worked for him?",
      "answer": "**Jagu's kindness:**\n- He gave Hari food (a tumbler of tea and a rolled-up chapati) without being asked and without expecting payment\n- He offered Hari a job when Hari said he had no money to pay for the food\n- He took in the two Tamil orphan boys whose parents were killed in a railway accident, giving them food, shelter, and work\n- The watchmaker described him as 'a silent man' but 'good to many'\n- He found the orphaned boys as he was coming to work and 'brought them here straightaway and gave them food and shelter and work, too'\n\n**Critical view of his treatment:**\nWhile Jagu was kind in taking these boys in, the working conditions were harsh:\n- They worked extremely hard in terrible heat with no rest\n- They were paid only one rupee a day\n- They seemed 'too tired and too sad to speak'\n- There was so much work and such heat that 'no one ever seemed to have the strength or the time to talk'\n\nThe author presents a complex picture - Jagu does what he can within his own limited means (he himself works hard all day), but the system still exploits children. His kindness is genuine but exists within harsh circumstances.",

        "i. the Sri Krishna Eating House had many pictures on the walls.",
        "ii. it had some pictures on the wall.",
        "iii. it had very few pictures on the wall.",
        "iv. it had no pictures on the wall."
      ],
      "answer": "iv. it had no pictures on the wall.\n\nThe phrase 'did not have even so much as' emphasizes that the restaurant had absolutely nothing - not even the most basic decoration like a simple picture of Krishna (after whom the restaurant was named). If there had ever been one, it had disappeared under the layers of grime and soot that coated the walls.",

        "i. not only the floor, but also the tables were black with soot.",
        "ii. everything in the place got the same amount of soot.",
        "iii. the stove, too, was black with soot, apart from everything else."
      ],
      "answer": "i. not only the floor, but also the tables were black with soot.\n\nThe sentence emphasizes that both the floor AND the wooden tables were black with soot. The phrase 'an even share of soot' means everything got equally covered because the open stoves spread soot throughout the small space during the constant cooking day and night.",

        "iii. the people appeared to have no fixed working hours, but in fact they did.",
        "iv. the people had fixed working hours."
      ],
      "answer": "i. the people had no fixed working hours.\n\nThe customers (beggars, coolies, and cart-pullers) did not have regular 9-to-5 jobs with set schedules. They worked whenever they could find work - some came before daylight, some late at night, some in between carrying loads. 'Seemed to' here confirms the observation that they genuinely had irregular schedules, not that it was just an appearance.",

        "iii. because they were working, they could not speak.",
        "iv. they were not allowed to speak as they worked."
      ],
      "answer": "i. they worked so hard, they had no time to speak.\n\nThe story explains that 'There was so much work and such heat in that small place that no one ever seemed to have the strength or the time to talk.' The boys and Hari worked in complete silence because they were exhausted from the hard work and heat. Also, there was a language barrier (Tamil vs Hindi/Marathi), but the main reason given is the exhausting nature of the work.",

      "answer": "**i. In what way was the restaurant 'the meanest'? What does this mean?**\n'Meanest' here means the most shabby, the most dilapidated, the lowest quality - the poorest and most run-down. The restaurant had:\n- Walls covered in layers of grime and soot\n- Cobwebs on the ceiling that trapped soot making it look like a furry blanket\n- Black floors and tables from soot\n- No decorations at all - not even a picture of Krishna\n- Open stoves where lentils were cooked all day\n\nEven the simple cafes in his village Thul were pleasanter than this place.\n\n**ii. Why was Hari there?**\nHari was there because a kind watchman from a big building on a hill had brought him to Bombay to find work and earn money. Hari had left his village Thul because his mother was very ill, his father was drunk most of the time, and he felt it was his duty to care for his family by earning money. He knew no one in the big city, and the watchman took him to this restaurant where he could get food and work.",

      "answer": "**i. Who is speaking?**\nJagu, the owner of the Sri Krishna Eating House, is speaking.\n\n**ii. What did he do just before giving this answer?**\nJust before giving this answer, he considered for only a moment, frowning as he thought about Hari's request.\n\n**iii. What was the question asked of him, and by whom?**\nHari had asked him: 'I have no money to pay for all this food you are giving me. Will you let me work in your kitchen instead?' Hari asked this after being handed a tumbler of tea and a rolled-up chapati without asking for anything.\n\n**iv. What did the speaker go on to say about the job?**\nJagu said: 'Start by washing these pots. Then you can knead the dough and help roll out the chapatis.

      "answer": "**i. Who was the old gentleman?**\nThe old gentleman was the watchmaker who owned the watch repair shop called 'Ding Dong Watchworks' next door to the eating house. He wore a small black cap and had an eye-piece fixed to his eye for examining watches. He worked at a minute watch that he held in the cup of his hand.\n\n**ii. To whom was the comment made?**\nThe comment was made to Hari, who had come out to empty a pail of garbage into the big concrete disposal units built on the roadside.\n\n**iii. What did the speaker do immediately after making this comment?**\nImmediately after making this comment, the old gentleman went back to his examination of the tiny watch. But he continued to talk to Hari, who stood on the pavement staring open-mouthed at all the clocks that hung tick-tocking on the walls and the watches that glittered in the showcases.",

      "answer": "**i. Who is speaking and to whom are the words addressed?**\nThe old watchmaker is speaking, and the words are addressed to Hari.\n\n**ii. What made the speaker ask the question?**\nHari had suddenly asked 'Sir, can you tell me where the post office is? I wish to buy a postcard.' This sudden question about writing made the watchmaker ask this with a laugh, winking at him from behind the eye-piece.\n\n**iii. What is the letter the speaker refers to?**\nThe letter refers to a postcard Hari wanted to write to his mother. He wanted to tell her: 'Dear Mother, I am in Bombay. I have a job. I will bring you my earnings. I hope you are well. I am well. Remember me to my sisters. Hari.'\n\n**iv. How did the speaker help?**\nThe speaker helped in several ways:\n- He told Hari where the post office was ('Go straight up the road; next to the electric substation, there is a post office')\n- He offered to lend Hari money for a postcard ('Have you money for a postcard or can I lend you some?')\n- He later lent Hari his ballpoint pen to write with, since the eating house owner was unlikely to have one",
