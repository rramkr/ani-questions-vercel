      "question": "In what ways was the Sri Krishna Eating House different from the restaurants in Thul?",
      "answer": "The Sri Krishna Eating House was the meanest and shabbiest restaurant Hari had ever seen. In contrast, the cafes in Thul were pleasanter - they were usually wooden shacks built in the shade of a mango or frangipani tree, with marigolds and hibiscus in an old ink bottle for a vase, coloured bottles of aerated drinks attractively arranged on shelves, and possibly a bright picture of a god or goddess with a tinsel garland. The Sri Krishna Eating House didn't even have a coloured picture of Krishna on the wall - just layers of grime and soot, cobwebs on the ceiling, and black floors and tables from soot.",

      "question": "What kind of people came to eat at the Sri Krishna Eating House? Why did they come to this particular restaurant?",
      "answer": "The customers were beggars and coolies who had stopped in between carrying their loads - sacks of coal and cylinders of gas - and cart-pullers who dragged goods through the city on long wooden hand-drawn carts. They came to this restaurant because it was certainly the cheapest restaurant anyone could possibly find in Bombay - even a beggar could afford to buy himself a meal here. These people had no fixed working hours and needed an affordable place to eat at any time.",

    {
      "id": "skeh_tq_3",
      "question": "Why was the restaurant in such a dilapidated condition?",
      "answer": "The restaurant was in a dilapidated condition because the owner had no time to sweep or clean it and no money to decorate it with pictures and flowers. He worked hard himself all day and had two boys to help him knead the dough and bake chapatis over open fires which they kept lit day and night. The customers came at all hours - some before daylight for leftovers of the night before, and some after midnight - so there was never any time for maintenance.",

    {
      "id": "skeh_tq_4",
      "question": "Why did the two boys in the kitchen not speak to Hari?",
      "answer": "The two boys did not speak to Hari because they spoke only Tamil, a language Hari did not know. They did not seem to know any Hindi or Marathi, the two languages Hari knew. So there was silence between them. Also, they were neither friendly nor inquisitive about him - they were simply too tired and too sad to speak. They worked so hard in such heat that no one seemed to have the strength or the time to talk.",

      "question": "Why did Hari like talking to the old man in the watch shop?",
      "answer": "Hari liked talking to the old watchmaker because the man proved to be friendly. He looked so much like Sayyid Ali, the man who had spoken so well at the meeting by the Black Horse in Thul, that Hari instantly felt here was another fine and impressive man whom he could trust and who would understand him and try to help him. The watchmaker was kind, showed interest in Hari, and helped him by telling him where the post office was and lending him money for a postcard.",

      "id": "skeh_tq_6",
      "question": "What does the phrase 'stared open-mouthed' suggest?",
      "answer": "The phrase 'stared open-mouthed' suggests that Hari was amazed and astonished. He stood on the pavement staring open-mouthed at all the clocks that hung tick-tocking on the walls and the watches that glittered in the showcases. Coming from a small village like Thul, he had never seen so many timepieces in one place, and it filled him with wonder and fascination.",

    {
      "id": "skeh_tq_7",
      "question": "Why was the owner of the watch shop 'more likely' to have a pen?",
      "answer": "The watchmaker was more likely to have a pen than the owner of the eating house because he was an educated man who ran a technical repair business. He needed to write receipts, make notes about watch repairs, and keep records. In contrast, Jagu, the eating house owner, was too busy with manual work - cooking, kneading dough, and serving customers - and probably had little need or use for writing implements in his line of work.",

      "question": "(HOTS) What made Hari both frightened and happy? What other feelings might he be experiencing? Why?",
      "answer": "Hari felt both happy and frightened when he wrote the postcard to his mother. He was happy because he had done what he knew he should do - inform his family that he was safe and had found work. He was frightened because sending the postcard meant he would be staying on in Bombay, not going home. Other feelings he might be experiencing include: loneliness (being far from family), anxiety (about his sick mother and drunk father), pride (in finding work and being independent), guilt (for leaving his sisters), hope (that he could earn money to help his family), and determination (to succeed despite difficulties).",

      "question": "(HOTS) In what ways was Jagu, the owner of the shop, kind? What do you think of the way he treated the boys who worked for him?",
      "answer": "Jagu showed kindness in several ways: He gave Hari food (tea and chapati) without being asked. He offered Hari a job when Hari said he had no money. He took in the two Tamil orphan boys whose parents were killed in a railway accident, giving them food, shelter, and work. He was described as 'a silent man' but 'good to many.' However, his treatment of the boys can be viewed critically: They worked extremely hard in terrible conditions with heat and no rest. They were paid only one rupee a day. They seemed 'too tired and too sad to speak.' While Jagu was kind compared to leaving them homeless, the working conditions were harsh. The author shows a complex picture - Jagu does what he can within his own limited means, but the system exploits children.",

      "question": "'But the Sri Krishna Eating House did not have even so much as a coloured picture of Krishna glued to the wall.' What does this mean?",
      "answer": "This means that the Sri Krishna Eating House had absolutely no pictures on the wall - not even a simple, inexpensive coloured picture of Lord Krishna (after whom the restaurant was named). The sentence emphasizes just how bare and undecorated the place was. Even the most basic decoration that one would expect in an Indian restaurant - a picture of a god - was absent. If there had ever been one, it had disappeared under the layers of grime and soot that coated the walls.",
      "key_points": ["Restaurant had no pictures at all", "Not even a basic picture of Krishna", "Emphasizes extreme bareness", "Any picture would have been covered by grime anyway"]

      "question": "'The floor and the wooden tables were all black, too, since they all got an even share of soot from the open stoves.' What does this mean?",
      "answer": "This means that not only the floor but also the wooden tables were completely black with soot. The soot came from the open stoves where food was cooked all day and night. Since the stoves were open fires (not enclosed), the soot spread everywhere in the small space, coating all surfaces equally - hence 'an even share of soot.' This shows the unhygienic and grimy conditions of the eating house where everything was covered in black soot from constant cooking.",

    {
      "id": "skeh_tq_12",
      "question": "'These people seemed to have no fixed working hours.' What does this mean?",
      "answer": "This means that the customers (beggars, coolies, and cart-pullers) did not have regular 9-to-5 jobs with set schedules. They worked whenever they could find work - some before daylight, some late at night, some in between carrying loads. They had no employers giving them fixed schedules. They came to eat at the restaurant at all different hours because their irregular work meant they were hungry at irregular times. This is why the restaurant was always open and the owner had no time to clean.",
      "key_points": ["Customers had irregular jobs", "No set work schedules", "Came to eat at all hours", "This kept the restaurant always busy"]

    {
      "id": "skeh_tq_13",
      "question": "'They did not speak to each other as they worked.' What does this mean?",
      "answer": "This means that Hari and the two Tamil boys worked in complete silence. They didn't chat or have conversations while working. There are two reasons: first, there was a language barrier (they spoke Tamil, Hari spoke Hindi/Marathi). Second, they worked so hard in such heat that they simply grunted and sweated - no one had the strength or time to talk. The work was exhausting and the conditions were harsh. This silence emphasizes the difficult working conditions and the isolation Hari felt.",

      "answer": "(i) 'Meanest' here means the most shabby, the most dilapidated, the lowest quality. The restaurant had no decorations, walls covered in grime and soot, cobwebs on the ceiling making it look like a furry blanket, black floors and tables from soot, and food cooked over open stoves in poor conditions. It was the poorest, most run-down eating place Hari had seen - even the simple cafes in his village Thul were nicer.\n\n(ii) Hari was there because a kind watchman from a big building on a hill had brought him to Bombay to find work and earn money. Hari had left his village Thul because his mother was very ill, his father was drunk most of the time, and he felt it was his duty to care for his family by earning money. He knew no one in the big city, and the watchman took him to this restaurant where he could get food and work.",

      "answer": "(i) Jagu, the owner of the Sri Krishna Eating House, is speaking.\n\n(ii) Just before giving this answer, he considered for only a moment, frowning as he thought about Hari's request.\n\n(iii) Hari had asked him: 'I have no money to pay for all this food you are giving me. Will you let me work in your kitchen instead?' Hari asked this after being handed a tumbler of tea and a rolled-up chapati without asking for anything.\n\n(iv) The speaker went on to say: 'Start by washing these pots. Then you can knead the dough and help roll out the chapatis. If you like, you can stay here and work for your meals and - uh - one rupee a day, like the other boys.'",

      "answer": "(i) The old gentleman was the watchmaker who owned the watch repair shop called 'Ding Dong Watchworks' next door to the eating house. He wore a small black cap and had an eye-piece fixed to his eye for examining watches.\n\n(ii) The comment was made to Hari, who had come out to empty a pail of garbage into the disposal units on the roadside.\n\n(iii) Immediately after making this comment, the old gentleman went back to his examination of a tiny watch, but continued to talk to Hari who stood on the pavement, staring open-mouthed at all the clocks on the walls and watches in the showcases.",

      "answer": "(i) The old watchmaker is speaking, and the words are addressed to Hari.\n\n(ii) Hari had suddenly asked 'Sir, can you tell me where the post office is? I wish to buy a postcard.' This sudden question about writing a letter made the watchmaker ask this.\n\n(iii) The letter refers to a postcard Hari wanted to write to his mother. He wanted to tell her that he was in Bombay, had found a job, would send his earnings, and asked her to remember him to his sisters.\n\n(iv) The speaker helped by: telling Hari where the post office was (straight up the road, next to the electric substation), offering to lend him money for a postcard, and later lending him a ballpoint pen to write with (since the eating house owner was unlikely to have one).",

He wrote his name in large letters to fill up the space, but did not include his address because he would be staying on in Bombay and not going home.
