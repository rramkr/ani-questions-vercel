      "question": "Reference to Context: 'The Sri Krishna Eating House was the meanest and shabbiest restaurant Hari had ever seen.'\n\n(i) In what way was the restaurant 'the meanest'? What does this mean?\n(ii) Why was Hari there?",
      "answer": "(i) 'Meanest' here means the most shabby, the most dilapidated, the lowest quality. The restaurant had no decorations, walls covered in grime and soot, cobwebs on the ceiling making it look like a furry blanket, black floors and tables from soot, and food cooked over open stoves in poor conditions. It was the poorest, most run-down eating place Hari had seen - even the simple cafes in his village Thul were nicer.\n\n(ii) Hari was there because a kind watchman from a big building on a hill had brought him to Bombay to find work and earn money. Hari had left his village Thul because his mother was very ill, his father was drunk most of the time, and he felt it was his duty to care for his family by earning money. He knew no one in the big city, and the watchman took him to this restaurant where he could get food and work.",

      "question": "Reference to Context: 'But the Sri Krishna Eating House did not have even so much as a coloured picture of Krishna glued to the wall.'\n\n(i) What does this sentence mean?\n(ii) What is ironic about the name of the restaurant?\n(iii) What had happened to any picture that might have been there?",
      "answer": "(i) This sentence means that the Sri Krishna Eating House had absolutely no pictures on the wall - not even a simple, inexpensive coloured picture of Lord Krishna (after whom the restaurant was named). The sentence emphasizes just how bare and undecorated the place was. Even the most basic decoration that one would expect in an Indian restaurant - a picture of a god - was absent.\n\n(ii) The irony is that despite being named after Lord Krishna, a beloved Hindu deity, the restaurant had no picture of Krishna at all. Indian restaurants typically have pictures of gods for blessings and decoration, but this one was so neglected that it didn't even have this basic religious symbol.\n\n(iii) If there had ever been a picture of Krishna on the wall, it had long since disappeared under layers of grime and soot from the open stoves. The accumulated dirt and soot over time would have completely covered and obscured any picture.",

      "question": "Reference to Context: 'The customers were beggars and coolies who had stopped in between carrying their loads – sacks of coal and cylinders of gas – and cart-pullers who dragged goods through the city on long wooden hand-drawn carts.'\n\n(i) Who were the main customers of the eating house?\n(ii) What does 'no fixed working hours' mean?\n(iii) Why did these people come to this particular restaurant?",
      "answer": "(i) The main customers were the city's poorest workers - beggars who had no regular income, coolies who carried heavy loads like sacks of coal and gas cylinders on their backs, and cart-pullers who dragged goods through the city on hand-drawn wooden carts. They were all from the lowest economic sections of society.\n\n(ii) 'No fixed working hours' means these customers did not have regular 9-to-5 jobs with set schedules. They worked whenever they could find work - some before daylight, some late at night, some in between carrying loads. They had no employers giving them fixed timings, so they came to eat at all different hours.\n\n(iii) These people came to this restaurant because it was certainly the cheapest restaurant anyone could possibly find in Bombay - even a beggar could afford to buy himself a meal here. The food was basic (dal and chapatis) but affordable, and the restaurant was always open to serve people who worked irregular hours.",

      "answer": "(i) Jagu, the owner of the Sri Krishna Eating House, is speaking.\n\n(ii) Just before giving this answer, he considered for only a moment, frowning as he thought about Hari's request. He was weighing whether he needed another worker and could afford to take on another boy.\n\n(iii) Hari had asked him: 'I have no money to pay for all this food you are giving me. Will you let me work in your kitchen instead?' Hari asked this after being handed a tumbler of tea and a rolled-up chapati without asking for anything.\n\n(iv) The speaker went on to say: 'Start by washing these pots. Then you can knead the dough and help roll out the chapatis. If you like, you can stay here and work for your meals and - uh - one rupee a day, like the other boys.'",

      "answer": "(i) 'They' refers to Hari and the two Tamil boys who worked at the eating house. These were the young workers who kneaded dough, baked chapatis, and served customers together.\n\n(ii) They didn't speak because of a language barrier - the two boys spoke only Tamil, a language Hari did not know. Hari knew Hindi and Marathi, but the Tamil boys didn't seem to know either of these languages. So there was complete silence between them as no communication was possible.\n\n(iii) The other boys were neither friendly nor inquisitive about Hari - they were simply too tired and too sad to speak. They worked so hard in such heat that no one seemed to have the strength or the time to talk. They just grunted and sweated as they worked. Their exhaustion and grief (they were orphans) left them with no energy for social interaction.",

      "answer": "(i) The old gentleman was the watchmaker who owned the watch repair shop called 'Ding Dong Watchworks' next door to the eating house. He wore a small black cap and had an eye-piece fixed to his eye for examining watches.\n\n(ii) The comment was made to Hari, who had come out to empty a pail of garbage into the disposal units on the roadside. The watchmaker noticed him and called out to start a conversation.\n\n(iii) Immediately after making this comment, the old gentleman went back to his examination of a tiny watch, but continued to talk to Hari who stood on the pavement, staring open-mouthed at all the clocks on the walls and watches in the showcases.",

      "answer": "(i) The old watchmaker is speaking, and the words are addressed to Hari.\n\n(ii) Hari had suddenly asked 'Sir, can you tell me where the post office is? I wish to buy a postcard.' This sudden question about writing a letter made the watchmaker ask this question with gentle understanding.\n\n(iii) The letter refers to a postcard Hari wanted to write to his mother. He wanted to tell her that he was in Bombay, had found a job, would send his earnings, and asked her to remember him to his sisters.\n\n(iv) The speaker helped in two ways: First, he told Hari where the post office was - straight up the road, next to the electric substation. Second, he offered to lend Hari money for a postcard, and later also lent him a ballpoint pen to write with since the eating house owner was unlikely to have one.",

      "answer": "(i) The old watchmaker is speaking to Hari, sharing information about Jagu, the owner of the eating house.\n\n(ii) 'A silent man' means Jagu was not talkative or communicative. He was always busy working - cooking, serving customers, and managing the restaurant - and had little time for conversation. He expressed himself through actions rather than words.\n\n(iii) Jagu was 'good to many' in several ways: He gave Hari food (tea and chapati) without being asked and offered him a job. He took in the two Tamil orphan boys whose parents were killed in a railway accident, giving them food, shelter, and work. He found these homeless boys and brought them straight to the eating house one morning when coming to work. Despite his own difficult circumstances, he helped those even more unfortunate than himself.",

      "answer": "(i) 'Their' refers to the two Tamil boys who worked at the eating house with Hari. They were the ones who spoke only Tamil and seemed too tired and sad to speak.\n\n(ii) The family lived on a railway platform because the father worked for the railways. Like many poor people who come to the city to find work, they had no proper home and lived on the platform where the father worked.\n\n(iii) A terrible tragedy occurred - both parents were killed when a train ran over them while they were crossing the railway line to fetch water from a pump. They died leaving their children orphaned.\n\n(iv) After their parents' death, Jagu found the orphaned boys one morning while coming to work. He brought them straight to the eating house and gave them food, shelter, and work. They became helpers at the restaurant, working for their meals and one rupee a day.",

Hari.'\n\n(i) Who wrote this and to whom?\n(ii) Why was the message so brief?\n(iii) Why did Hari write his name in large letters?\n(iv) Why did he not write his address?",
      "answer": "(i) Hari wrote this postcard to his mother back in Thul village. It was the first communication with his family since he came to Bombay.\n\n(ii) The message was brief for several reasons: A postcard has limited space for writing. Hari probably wasn't highly educated, so he kept it simple. Most importantly, he just wanted to convey the essential information - that he was safe, had found work, and was thinking of his family.\n\n(iii) Hari wrote his name in large letters to fill up the remaining space on the postcard. He had said everything he needed to say, and the large signature was a simple way to complete the card while making it easy for his family to recognize who it was from.\n\n(iv) Hari did not write his address because he had decided to stay on in Bombay, not to go home immediately. By not giving his address, he was signaling that he couldn't be reached or called back - he was committed to staying and working. Writing the postcard made him feel both happy (he had done the right thing) and frightened (he was confirming his decision to stay far from home).",

      "answer": "(i) The old watchmaker from Ding Dong Watchworks is being described. Hari noticed that he looked very similar to someone he knew from his village.\n\n(ii) Sayyid Ali was a man from Hari's village, Thul, who had spoken impressively at a meeting by the Black Horse. He was clearly a respected, educated man who could speak well and was memorable enough that Hari immediately recognized the similarity in someone else.\n\n(iii) The resemblance was important to Hari because it made him feel he could trust the watchmaker. In a strange, overwhelming city where he knew no one, finding someone who reminded him of a respected figure from home gave Hari comfort and confidence. He instantly felt here was another fine and impressive man whom he could trust and who would understand him and try to help him. This connection to his village helped Hari feel less alone.",

      "answer": "(i) This sentence describes the dirty, soot-covered condition of the Sri Krishna Eating House. It shows how the floor and all the wooden tables in the restaurant had turned completely black from accumulated soot.\n\n(ii) The floor and tables were black because they were covered with soot from the open stoves where food was cooked all day and night. The stoves were open fires (not enclosed), so the soot from the burning fuel spread everywhere in the small space and settled on all surfaces.\n\n(iii) 'An even share of soot' suggests that the soot spread equally everywhere - no surface was spared. The floor, the tables, and everything else received the same coating of black soot. This phrase emphasizes how thoroughly dirty the entire restaurant was, with no clean areas. It also suggests the continuous nature of the cooking, with fires burning constantly and soot accumulating over time.",
