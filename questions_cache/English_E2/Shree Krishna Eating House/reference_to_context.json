      "extract": "The Sri Krishna Eating House was the meanest and shabbiest restaurant Hari had ever seen. In Thul the cafes were usually pleasanter – wooden shacks built in the shade of a mango or frangipani tree, with marigolds and hibiscus in an old ink bottle for a vase, coloured bottles of aerated drinks attractively arranged on shelves, and possibly a bright picture of a god or goddess with a tinsel garland.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) In what way was the Sri Krishna Eating House 'the meanest'? What does this mean?",
          "answer": "'Meanest' here means the most shabby, the lowest quality, and the most dilapidated. The restaurant had no decorations, walls covered in grime and soot, cobwebs on the ceiling, and black floors and tables from soot. It was the poorest, most run-down eating place Hari had seen."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) How were the cafes in Thul different from the Sri Krishna Eating House?",
          "answer": "The cafes in Thul were pleasanter - they were wooden shacks built in the shade of trees, decorated with flowers (marigolds and hibiscus) in ink bottles, had coloured bottles of drinks arranged attractively on shelves, and bright pictures of gods with tinsel garlands. The Sri Krishna Eating House had none of these pleasant features."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) Why was Hari at this restaurant?",
          "answer": "Hari was at the Sri Krishna Eating House because he had come to Bombay (Mumbai) to find work and earn money for his family. His mother was ill and his father was often drunk, so he felt it was his duty to support the family. A watchman had brought him to this restaurant where he could get food and work."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What does this comparison tell us about Hari's feelings?",
          "answer": "The comparison tells us that Hari felt disappointed and homesick. Even the simple cafes of his village Thul were more pleasant than this city restaurant. It highlights the contrast between his peaceful village life and the harsh reality of his new life in Bombay, showing how far he had fallen in circumstances."

      "extract": "But the Sri Krishna Eating House did not have even so much as a coloured picture of Krishna glued to the wall. If there had ever been one, it had long since disappeared under layers of grime and soot. The ceiling, too, was so thickly covered with cobwebs that it looked like some kind of furry blanket. The floor and the wooden tables were all black, too, since they all got an even share of soot from the open stoves.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) What is ironic about the name 'Sri Krishna Eating House'?",
          "answer": "The irony is that despite being named after Lord Krishna, the eating house did not have even a simple coloured picture of Krishna on the wall. Indian restaurants typically have pictures of gods, but this one was so neglected that any picture would have disappeared under the layers of grime and soot."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) What does the phrase 'furry blanket' refer to? Why is this image used?",
          "answer": "The phrase 'furry blanket' refers to the thick layer of cobwebs covering the ceiling. The poet uses this image to show how extremely dirty and neglected the place was - the cobwebs were so thick and accumulated that they looked like a blanket made of fur, completely covering the ceiling."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) Why were the floor and tables black?",
          "answer": "The floor and wooden tables were black because they were covered with soot from the open stoves where food was cooked day and night. Since the stoves were open fires (not enclosed), the soot spread everywhere in the small space, coating all surfaces equally."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What do these details reveal about the owner's circumstances?",
          "answer": "These details reveal that the owner was extremely poor and overworked. He had no time to clean or maintain the place and no money to decorate it. He was too busy cooking and serving customers who came at all hours to do any housekeeping."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "skeh_rtc_3",
      "extract": "The customers were beggars and coolies who had stopped in between carrying their loads – sacks of coal and cylinders of gas – and cart-pullers who dragged goods through the city on long wooden hand-drawn carts. These people seemed to have no fixed working hours.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) Who were the main customers of the eating house?",
          "answer": "The main customers were beggars, coolies (labourers who carried heavy loads like sacks of coal and gas cylinders), and cart-pullers who dragged goods through the city on hand-drawn wooden carts. They were all from the poorest sections of society."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) What does 'no fixed working hours' mean?",
          "answer": "'No fixed working hours' means these customers did not have regular 9-to-5 jobs with set schedules. They worked whenever they could find work - some before daylight, some late at night, some in between carrying loads. They had no employers giving them fixed timings."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) Why did these customers come to this particular restaurant?",
          "answer": "They came to this restaurant because it was the cheapest restaurant in Bombay - even a beggar could afford to buy a meal here. It was open at all hours to serve people who worked irregular schedules, and the food was basic but affordable."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What does this tell us about life in the city for poor people?",
          "answer": "This tells us that life in the city for poor people was extremely difficult. They had to do hard physical labour carrying heavy loads, had no job security or fixed income, worked at all hours, and could barely afford basic food. The city was harsh for those at the bottom of society."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) What phrase tells us that this was a very cheap restaurant?",
          "answer": "The phrase that tells us this was a very cheap restaurant is that 'even a beggar could afford to buy himself a meal here.' If beggars - the poorest people in society - could afford to eat there, it must have been the cheapest possible option."

      "extract": "'Then he said, Yes, I can do with another boy in the kitchen.' Jagu considered for only a moment, frowning as he thought. 'Start by washing these pots. Then you can knead the dough and help roll out the chapatis. If you like, you can stay here and work for your meals and – uh – one rupee a day, like the other boys.'",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) Who is speaking and to whom?",
          "answer": "Jagu, the owner of the Sri Krishna Eating House, is speaking to Hari, the young boy from Thul who had asked for work at the restaurant."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) What had Hari asked just before this?",
          "answer": "Hari had asked: 'I have no money to pay for all this food you are giving me. Will you let me work in your kitchen instead?' He made this offer after Jagu handed him tea and a chapati without being asked."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) What work was Hari expected to do?",
          "answer": "Hari was expected to wash pots first, then knead the dough for chapatis, and help roll out the chapatis. These were the basic kitchen tasks at the eating house."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What payment would Hari receive for his work?",
          "answer": "Hari would receive his meals (food to eat) and one rupee a day in wages - the same as the other boys working at the eating house. It was very little pay for hard work."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) What does Jagu's brief consideration tell us about him?",
          "answer": "Jagu's brief consideration shows that he was a practical man who made quick decisions. The fact that he 'frowned' suggests he was thinking seriously, but he didn't hesitate long because he genuinely needed help and was willing to give Hari a chance."

    {
      "id": "skeh_rtc_5",
      "extract": "They did not speak to each other as they worked – Hari did not know a word of their language, Tamil, and they did not seem to know any Hindi or Marathi. So there was silence between them. Also, they were neither friendly nor inquisitive about him – they were simply too tired and too sad to speak.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) Who are 'they' in this extract?",
          "answer": "'They' refers to the two Tamil boys who worked at the eating house with Hari. They were orphans whose parents had been killed in a railway accident, and Jagu had taken them in."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) Why was there silence between Hari and the other boys?",
          "answer": "There was silence because of a language barrier - the boys spoke only Tamil while Hari knew only Hindi and Marathi. They could not communicate with each other as they had no common language."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) Why were the boys 'too tired and too sad to speak'?",
          "answer": "The boys were exhausted from working extremely hard in stifling heat, cooking over open fires day and night. They were sad because they were orphans who had lost their parents tragically in a railway accident and now had to work hard just to survive."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What does this passage tell us about the working conditions?",
          "answer": "This passage tells us the working conditions were so harsh that workers had no energy left for conversation. The heat was stifling, the work was continuous, and the environment was so exhausting that basic human interaction became impossible."

      "extract": "'So, a new boy at the Sri Krishna Eating House,' called the old gentleman. He was peering through an eye-piece at the inside of a very small watch. But now he looked up and, still with the eye-piece fixed to his eye, smiled at Hari who stood on the pavement, staring open-mouthed at all the clocks that hung tick-tocking on the walls and the watches that glittered in the showcases.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) Who is the 'old gentleman'?",
          "answer": "The old gentleman is the watchmaker who owned the watch repair shop called 'Ding Dong Watchworks' next door to the Sri Krishna Eating House. He wore a small black cap and used an eye-piece for examining watches."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) What was Hari doing when the old man spoke to him?",
          "answer": "Hari had come out to empty a pail of garbage into the disposal units on the roadside. He stopped on the pavement and stood staring open-mouthed at all the clocks on the walls and watches glittering in the showcases of the watch shop."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) What does 'staring open-mouthed' tell us about Hari?",
          "answer": "'Staring open-mouthed' tells us that Hari was amazed and astonished by the sight of so many timepieces. Coming from a small village like Thul, he had never seen so many clocks and watches in one place, and it filled him with wonder."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) Why is the watchmaker important in the story?",
          "answer": "The watchmaker becomes important because he befriends Hari and helps him. He reminds Hari of Sayyid Ali from his village, making Hari feel he can trust him. The watchmaker tells Hari about the post office, lends him money for a postcard, and provides a 'beacon of hope' in Hari's difficult life."

'Go straight up that road there and you will find the post office next to the electric sub-station. Here, I will lend you the money for the postcard.'",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) Who is speaking and to whom?",
          "answer": "The old watchmaker is speaking to Hari, who had suddenly asked where the post office was because he wanted to buy a postcard to write to his family."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) What does 'suddenly remembered' suggest?",
          "answer": "'Suddenly remembered' suggests that Hari had been so overwhelmed by his new life in Bombay that he had not thought about contacting his family. The watchmaker's friendly conversation triggered the memory that he should write home to let them know he was safe."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) How did the watchmaker help Hari?",
          "answer": "The watchmaker helped Hari in two ways: he gave him directions to the post office (straight up the road, next to the electric sub-station), and he lent Hari money to buy a postcard since Hari had no money of his own."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What does this act of kindness reveal about the watchmaker?",
          "answer": "This act of kindness reveals that the watchmaker was genuinely caring and helpful. Without being asked, he offered to lend money to a boy he barely knew. He understood Hari's situation and wanted to help him stay connected with his family."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) Why did Hari want to write home?",
          "answer": "Hari wanted to write home to tell his mother that he was in Bombay, had found a job, and would send his earnings. He wanted his family to know he was safe and hadn't abandoned them. The postcard would reassure his worried family."

Their father worked for the railways and they lived on the platform. One day a train ran over the parents as they were crossing the line to fetch water from the pump.'",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) Who is Jagu and why is he called 'a silent man'?",
          "answer": "Jagu is the owner of the Sri Krishna Eating House. He is called 'a silent man' because he was always busy working - cooking, serving customers, and managing the restaurant - and had little time for conversation. He communicated through actions rather than words."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) What does 'good to many' tell us about Jagu?",
          "answer": "'Good to many' tells us that despite his silent nature, Jagu was kind and helpful to people. He gave Hari food and work, and he had taken in the two orphaned Tamil boys, providing them food, shelter, and employment."

          "question": "(iii) What tragic event happened to the two Tamil boys?",

          "question": "(iv) What happened to the boys after their parents died?",
          "answer": "After their parents died, Jagu found the orphaned boys one morning while coming to work. He brought them straight to the eating house and gave them food, shelter, and work. He saved them from being homeless and starving on the streets."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) What does this information add to our understanding of the story?",
          "answer": "This information helps us understand why the Tamil boys were 'too tired and too sad to speak.' They had suffered a terrible tragedy, losing both parents suddenly. It also shows that despite the harsh conditions at the eating house, Jagu provided a refuge for the helpless, making the story more nuanced."

          "question": "(i) What did Hari write on the postcard?",
          "answer": "Hari wrote a short message telling his mother he was in Bombay, had found a job, and would bring his earnings home. He hoped she was well, said he was well, and asked to be remembered to his sisters. He signed it 'Hari' in large letters."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) Why was the message so brief?",
          "answer": "The message was brief because a postcard has limited space for writing, and Hari probably wasn't highly educated so he kept it simple. Also, he just wanted to convey the essential information - that he was safe, employed, and thinking of family."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) Why did Hari write his name in large letters?",
          "answer": "Hari wrote his name in large letters to fill up the remaining space on the postcard. It was a simple way to complete the card, and the large signature would make it easy for his family to recognize who the postcard was from."

        {
          "question": "(iv) Why did Hari not write his address?",
          "answer": "Hari did not write his address because he had decided to stay in Bombay and not go home immediately. By not giving his address, he was signaling that he couldn't be reached or called back - he was committed to staying and working."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) What mixed feelings did Hari experience while writing this?",
          "answer": "Hari felt both happy and frightened. He was happy because he had done what he should - informed his family that he was safe and employed. He was frightened because sending the postcard confirmed his decision to stay in Bombay, far from home, facing an uncertain future."

        {
          "question": "(iii) Why was this resemblance important to Hari?",
          "answer": "The resemblance was important because it made Hari feel he could trust the watchmaker. In a strange, overwhelming city where he knew no one, finding someone who reminded him of a respected figure from home gave him comfort and confidence to open up."

          "answer": "This tells us Hari was lonely and looking for connection in the unfamiliar city. He desperately needed someone he could trust and talk to. The resemblance to someone from home provided emotional comfort and a sense of security in his difficult situation."
