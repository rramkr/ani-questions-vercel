      "question": "Describe the three main ideas in the poem and explain which is most important.",
      "answer": "The poem 'Daffodils' contains three main ideas.\n\nFirst, about the poet himself - his solitary nature, habit of taking countryside walks, and his keen observation skills. We learn that he enjoys walking alone in nature and notices beauty in great detail.\n\nSecond, about nature - the daffodils, lake, trees, and waves are described vividly. The flowers are shown as golden, dancing, stretching endlessly along the bay, more joyful than even the sparkling waves.\n\nThird, and most important, is the relationship between the poet and nature - experiencing natural beauty creates lasting memories that become inner wealth. The poet did not realize at the time how valuable this experience would become.\n\nThe third idea is most important because it is Wordsworth's central message. A single moment in nature can become a permanent treasure that brings happiness throughout life. The 'inward eye' allows us to relive beautiful moments, making solitude blissful. This relationship between humans and nature, and how nature enriches human life forever, is the poem's deepest meaning.",
      "justification": "The three ideas progress from personal to natural to philosophical, with the human-nature relationship being the culminating theme."

      "question": "How does Wordsworth use figures of speech to bring daffodils to life?",
      "answer": "Wordsworth uses multiple figures of speech to transform simple flowers into living, joyful beings.\n\nPersonification is the most important device. The daffodils are called a 'crowd' and 'jocund company' (like a gathering of cheerful people). They 'dance' and 'flutter' (human movements). They 'toss their heads' as if they have heads like people. Even the poet's heart 'dances with the Daffodils' at the end.\n\nSimiles are used effectively twice. First, the poet compares himself to a cloud ('lonely as a cloud'), establishing his initial solitude. Second, the daffodils are compared to stars in the Milky Way ('Continuous as the stars that shine'), emphasizing their vast number and sparkling beauty.\n\nHyperbole appears in 'ten thousand saw I at a glance' - an exaggeration to convey the overwhelming quantity of flowers.\n\nMetaphor is used when the experience is called 'wealth' - the precious treasure of memory.\n\nThrough these devices, Wordsworth transforms ordinary yellow flowers into dancing, joyful companions capable of bringing lasting happiness. The daffodils become alive, relatable, and emotionally significant rather than mere botanical specimens.",
      "justification": "The combination of figures of speech creates the poem's magical quality where nature becomes animated and meaningful."

      "question": "Explain how the poem shows that memories bring happiness years later.",
      "answer": "The poem beautifully demonstrates how a single beautiful experience can become a source of lasting happiness through memory.\n\nThe first three stanzas describe the actual moment of seeing the daffodils - the immediate, physical joy of encountering thousands of golden flowers dancing by the lake. The poet was happy in that moment, gazing at the joyful sight.\n\nThe final stanza shifts dramatically. Now the poet is lying on his couch, indoors, perhaps years later, in a 'vacant or pensive mood' - feeling empty or thoughtful. Suddenly, the memory of the daffodils 'flashes' upon his 'inward eye' (his imagination/memory). This flash is sudden and vivid, bringing the image back clearly.\n\nThe result is remarkable: 'my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the Daffodils.' The memory recreates the original joy. The word 'oft' (often) tells us this happens repeatedly - the poet can access this happiness again and again.\n\nWordsworth calls memory the 'bliss of solitude' because it transforms being alone from loneliness into happiness. The experience has become 'wealth' - a permanent treasure that enriches the poet's life forever. This is the poem's profound message: connecting with nature creates memories that become endless sources of joy.",
      "justification": "The poem's structure itself demonstrates the theme - moving from present experience to future memory, showing how beauty becomes lasting wealth."

      "question": "What makes 'Daffodils' a Romantic poem? Discuss its key Romantic characteristics.",
      "answer": "'Daffodils' by William Wordsworth is a quintessential Romantic poem, displaying several key characteristics of the Romantic movement.\n\nFirst, the celebration of nature is central. The poem glorifies the beauty of daffodils, describing them in vivid, loving detail. Nature is not just scenery but a source of profound spiritual and emotional experience.\n\nSecond, the importance of individual emotion is paramount. The poem is written in the first person ('I wandered'), focusing on the poet's personal feelings and responses. The emotional journey from loneliness to joy is the poem's core.\n\nThird, the value of solitude appears throughout. The poet walks alone, and later, solitude becomes 'bliss' through memory. Romantic poets valued time alone in nature for self-reflection and spiritual renewal.\n\nFourth, imagination and memory are celebrated. The 'inward eye' - the power to recall and relive experiences - is called a source of bliss. Romantics valued imagination as a gateway to deeper truths.\n\nFifth, simple language and subjects are used. Wordsworth chose common flowers and everyday experiences, believing poetry should use 'the language of common men' to express profound truths.\n\nSixth, nature's transformative power is demonstrated. The daffodils transform the poet's mood and become permanent inner wealth, showing nature's ability to heal and enrich human life.",
      "justification": "The poem exemplifies Romantic ideals through its celebration of nature, emotion, solitude, and imagination."

      "question": "Write about the poet William Wordsworth and explain how this poem reflects his beliefs.",
      "answer": "William Wordsworth (1770-1850) was one of the greatest English poets and a founder of the Romantic movement. He was born in the Lake District of England, a beautiful region of mountains, lakes, and valleys that inspired much of his poetry.\n\nWordsworth believed strongly in the power of nature to heal, teach, and enrich human life. He felt that modern civilization was taking people away from nature, causing spiritual harm. His famous statement was that poetry should be 'the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings' arising from 'emotion recollected in tranquillity.'\n\n'Daffodils' perfectly reflects these beliefs:\n\nFirst, nature's healing power - the lonely poet is transformed by encountering the joyful daffodils. His loneliness becomes happiness through nature's beauty.\n\nSecond, the lasting value of natural experiences - the memory of daffodils becomes permanent 'wealth' that enriches the poet's life forever, showing Wordsworth's belief that nature provides lasting spiritual nourishment.\n\nThird, emotion recollected in tranquillity - the final stanza shows the poet calmly remembering the experience, with the emotion returning powerfully. This matches Wordsworth's theory of poetic composition.\n\nFourth, the celebration of simple beauty - Wordsworth chose ordinary wildflowers, not grand subjects, showing his belief that profound poetry could emerge from humble nature.\n\nThe poem is autobiographical, based on a walk Wordsworth took with his sister Dorothy in 1802 when they encountered a field of daffodils.",
      "justification": "Understanding Wordsworth's life and beliefs helps appreciate the poem's deeper significance as an expression of Romantic philosophy."
