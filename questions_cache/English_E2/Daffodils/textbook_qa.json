      "question": "What figure of speech is used in the first line? Explain its meaning.",

      "justification": "A simile uses 'like' or 'as' to compare. 'Lonely as a cloud' establishes the poet's initial mood of solitude."

      "question": "What were the daffodils doing? What does this suggest?",
      "answer": "The daffodils were fluttering and dancing in the breeze, appearing lively and joyful. The poet sees them as happy, active beings rather than mere plants.",

      "question": "What simile is used in this extract? Explain its effectiveness.",
      "answer": "The simile compares the daffodils to the stars in the Milky Way using 'as'. Just like the countless stars that form a glowing band across the night sky, the daffodils formed a long, unbroken line of golden colour along the bay. This emphasizes their vast number and brightness.",

      "question": "What is the meaning of 'sprightly dance'? What figure of speech is this?",
      "answer": "'Sprightly' means lively, energetic, and full of spirit. 'Sprightly dance' describes the lively movement of the daffodils in the wind. This is personification as the flowers are given the human quality of dancing.",

      "question": "What 'wealth' did the 'show' bring to the poet?",

      "question": "How is the last verse different from the other verses?",
      "answer": "The last verse is set at a different time and place.
