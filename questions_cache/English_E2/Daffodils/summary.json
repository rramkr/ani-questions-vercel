      "question": "About the Poet",
      "answer": "**William Wordsworth (1770-1850)**\n\nOne of the greatest English poets, born in the Lake District of England - an area of great beauty.\n\nWordsworth's treatment of nature is his chief glory as a poet. He spent a great amount of time on walks in the countryside and used his keen sense of observation to note all that he saw around him.\n\nHe got much joy out of nature and this is clearly evident in his poetry. He always felt there was something much deeper than what was visible only on the surface. He looks on nature with his 'inward eye' and the glory of it enters into his heart and soul."
