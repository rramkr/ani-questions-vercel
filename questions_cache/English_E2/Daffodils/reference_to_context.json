      "question": "What figure of speech is used in the first line? Explain its meaning.",

      "question": "Why is the cloud described as 'lonely'? What does it tell us about the poet?",

      "extract": "\"For oft, when on my couch I lie\nIn vacant or in pensive mood\"",
      "question": "What is the setting described in these lines?",
      "answer": "The setting is the poet's home, specifically his couch where he lies alone. He is indoors, at rest, in a quiet moment of solitude. This is a contrast to the earlier outdoor setting by the lake, showing how the experience has travelled from the external world into his internal world of memory.",
      "justification": "The shift in setting emphasizes the transition from experience to memory."

      "extract": "\"Continuous as the stars that shine\nAnd twinkle on the milky way\"",
      "question": "What two qualities of stars are highlighted in these lines?",
      "answer": "The two qualities highlighted are 'shine' and 'twinkle'. Shining suggests brightness and radiance, while twinkling suggests flickering, sparkling movement. Together, they create an image of daffodils that are both brilliantly bright and moving with a sparkling, animated quality.",
      "justification": "Both qualities - brightness and movement - are transferred to the daffodils."
