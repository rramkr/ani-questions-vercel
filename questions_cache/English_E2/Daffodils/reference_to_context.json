      "question": "Reference to Context: 'I wandered lonely as a cloud\nThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\nA host of golden Daffodils;'\n\n(i) What figure of speech is used in the first line? Explain its meaning.\n(ii) What does 'vales' mean? Where was the poet wandering?\n(iii) What did the poet suddenly see?\n(iv) What is meant by 'a host of golden Daffodils'?",
      "answer": "(i) The figure of speech is a simile. The poet compares himself to a cloud using 'as'. Just as a cloud floats alone and aimlessly in the sky, the poet was wandering by himself without any fixed destination.\n\n(ii) 'Vales' means valleys. The poet was wandering over valleys and hills in the countryside of the Lake District, walking alone through the natural landscape.\n\n(iii) The poet suddenly saw a large number (a crowd or host) of golden daffodils. They were beside a lake and beneath the trees, growing along the water's edge.\n\n(iv) 'A host' means a large number or multitude. 'Golden' refers to their bright yellow colour.

      "question": "Reference to Context: 'I wandered lonely as a cloud\nThat floats on high o'er vales and hills'\n\n(i) Why is the cloud described as 'lonely'? What does it tell us about the poet?\n(ii) What does 'floats on high' mean? What image does it create?\n(iii) What is the contrast between the poet's mood and what he is about to see?",
      "answer": "(i) The cloud is described as lonely because clouds often float alone in the sky, separate from everything below. This tells us the poet was in a state of solitude and perhaps feeling disconnected, wandering without company through the countryside.\n\n(ii) 'Floats on high' means floating up above in the sky. It creates an image of a cloud moving peacefully and effortlessly high above the valleys and hills. This suggests the poet felt detached from the world below, moving without purpose or direction.\n\n(iii) The poet was lonely and wandering aimlessly, while the daffodils he is about to see appear joyful and lively, dancing in the breeze. This contrast shows how nature's beauty can transform a person's mood from loneliness to joy.",

What does this suggest?\n(iii) Identify and explain the personification in these lines.\n(iv) What does the word 'fluttering' suggest about the daffodils?",
      "answer": "(i) The daffodils were located beside a lake and beneath some trees. They were growing along the water's edge, in a scenic lakeside setting.\n\n(ii) The daffodils were fluttering and dancing in the breeze, appearing lively and joyful. The poet sees them as happy, active beings rather than mere plants.\n\n(iii) The personification is found in 'Fluttering and dancing in the breeze'. The daffodils are given human qualities - the ability to dance. This makes them seem alive, joyful, and like companions to the lonely poet.\n\n(iv) 'Fluttering' suggests quick, light, trembling movements - like wings or fabric in the wind. It creates an image of delicate, rapid motion as the flowers sway in the breeze, adding to the sense of the daffodils being alive and active.",

      "question": "Reference to Context: 'Continuous as the stars that shine\nAnd twinkle on the milky way,\nThey stretched in never-ending line\nAlong the margin of a bay:'\n\n(i) What simile is used? Explain its effectiveness.\n(ii) What is the 'milky way'? Why compare daffodils to it?\n(iii) What does 'margin of a bay' mean?\n(iv) What does 'never-ending line' suggest about the daffodils?",
      "answer": "(i) The simile compares daffodils to stars in the Milky Way - 'continuous as the stars that shine and twinkle'. This conveys their vast number and sparkling brightness effectively. Stars are countless (quantity), shine and twinkle (brightness), and form a continuous band, elevating the flowers to cosmic magnificence.\n\n(ii) The Milky Way is our galaxy, visible as a bright band of millions of stars across the night sky. The daffodils seemed equally numerous, continuous, and sparkling. This astronomical comparison shows how overwhelmed the poet was by the sight.\n\n(iii) 'Margin of a bay' means the edge or shore of a bay. The daffodils were arranged in a never-ending line along this shoreline, where the land meets the water.\n\n(iv) 'Never-ending line' is hyperbole suggesting the flowers stretched so far that their row seemed infinite. It emphasizes the overwhelming abundance of flowers that amazed the poet, making the sight seem endless and magnificent.",

Is it literal?\n(ii) What does 'at a glance' suggest?\n(iii) What does 'tossing their heads in sprightly dance' mean?\n(iv) What does 'sprightly' mean? How does it describe the daffodils?",
      "answer": "(i) 'Ten thousand' is hyperbole (exaggeration) emphasizing the enormous quantity. The poet couldn't literally count them; they seemed countless. The exaggeration creates poetic effect and shows his amazement.\n\n(ii) 'At a glance' means with just one look. It suggests the poet could see ten thousand flowers all at once without having to look around. This emphasizes how numerous and widespread the daffodils were - visible everywhere in a single view.\n\n(iii) The daffodils were bobbing in the wind as if dancing cheerfully. This is personification - giving flowers human qualities of having heads and dancing. It makes the flowers seem like joyful dancers at a celebration.\n\n(iv) 'Sprightly' means lively, energetic, and full of spirit. It describes the daffodils as being full of life and energy, dancing cheerfully in the breeze like happy beings enjoying themselves.",

      "answer": "(i) The two qualities highlighted are 'shine' and 'twinkle'. Shining suggests brightness and radiance, while twinkling suggests flickering, sparkling movement. Together, they create an image of daffodils that are both brilliantly bright and moving with a sparkling, animated quality.\n\n(ii) The comparison to stars elevates the daffodils from ordinary flowers to something cosmic and magnificent. Stars are associated with vastness, beauty, and eternity. By comparing the daffodils to stars, the poet suggests their number is countless, their brightness is sparkling, and their beauty is celestial.\n\n(iii) The poet uses a celestial comparison to show how deeply the ordinary flowers affected him. To him, they weren't just flowers - they were as magnificent and awe-inspiring as the stars in the sky. This comparison elevates nature to something divine and eternal.",

Their vibrant colour created a more joyful impression than the waves.\n\n(iii) 'Jocund' means cheerful or merry. 'Jocund company' treats the daffodils as cheerful friends whose presence brings joy. Calling daffodils 'company' personifies them as companions who provide pleasant companionship.\n\n(iv) The joyful sight was so overwhelming that happiness was unavoidable.

The 'wealth' is the precious memory that would bring happiness for years to come. It is metaphorical wealth - the treasure of memory, not monetary riches.\n\n(iii) 'Show' refers to the magnificent display of golden daffodils dancing by the lake. The poet calls it a 'show' because the flowers seemed to be performing for him, like actors on a stage, creating a spectacle of beauty and joy.\n\n(iv) The poet says he 'little thought' because at that moment, he was simply enjoying the beautiful sight without realizing its lasting value.

It tells us that while both the waves and daffodils danced, the flowers were even more joyful than the water. The daffodils' joy exceeded that of the sparkling waves, showing their supreme cheerfulness.\n\n(iii) The poet compares daffodils to waves to show both elements of nature were animated and alive. However, this comparison also allows him to establish that the daffodils were even more joyful, making them superior in their expression of happiness.\n\n(iv) 'Sparkling' suggests that the waves were bright and glittering in the sunlight, reflecting light as they moved.

The memory returns frequently in his quiet, solitary moments.\n\n(ii) The 'inward eye' is imagination or memory - seeing images in our mind. It's the 'bliss of solitude' because it brings happiness when alone. When we are solitary, our inner vision can recall beautiful experiences and bring us joy.\n\n(iii) 'Vacant' is when the mind is empty and idle, not thinking about anything particular. 'Pensive' is thoughtful and reflective, in a contemplative state. Both are quiet, solitary states, and the memory helps bring joy in either situation.\n\n(iv) His heart fills with pleasure and feels like dancing with the daffodils. The sudden, vivid recollection brings immediate joy. 'Flash' suggests suddenness - the memory instantly changes his mood from emptiness or pensiveness to happiness.",

Loneliness transforms into blissful solitude.\n\n(iv) The phrase 'bliss of solitude' shows that being alone can be a source of happiness, not loneliness. When the poet is alone, his imagination and memory bring him joy by recalling beautiful experiences like the daffodils. This transforms the meaning of solitude from something negative to positive.",

      "answer": "(i) The setting is the poet's home, specifically his couch where he lies alone. He is indoors, at rest, in a quiet moment of solitude. This is a contrast to the earlier outdoor setting by the lake, showing how the experience has travelled from the external world into his internal world of memory.\n\n(ii) This stanza takes place at a different time and location. Earlier stanzas describe the actual encounter by the lake, while this describes the poet at home, on his couch, remembering the scene.

It appears instantly and brightly in his mind, bringing immediate joy. The memory is not gradual but instant and clear.\n\n(iv) This tells us that memory has the power to preserve beautiful experiences and bring them back to us whenever we need them.
