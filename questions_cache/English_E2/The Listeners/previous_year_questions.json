      "question": "Reference to Context: 'And a bird flew up out of the turret, Above the Traveller's head: And he smote upon the door a second time;'\n\n(i) Why did the Traveller smote on the door the second time?\n(ii) Why was the Traveller perplexed?\n(iii) What stirred and shook the air? What does the stirring and shaking of the air tell us about the house?\n(iv) Why do you think the traveller had come there?\n(v) Name the poem and the poet.",
      "answer": "(i) The Traveller smote (knocked hard) on the door the second time because he had received no answer to his first knock. His increasing force shows his determination and perhaps frustration at the eerie silence. He was persistent in trying to get a response.\n\n(ii) The Traveller was perplexed because he could feel that there was someone inside the house, yet no one answered his calls. He sensed their strangeness and their stillness answering his cry - he felt the presence of the phantom listeners through intuition but received no actual response.\n\n(iii) The Traveller's voice (his call/shouts) stirred and shook the air. The poem says the listeners stood 'Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken / By the voice from the world of men.' This tells us that the house was so silent and still that even the Traveller's voice disturbed the air dramatically. It emphasizes the eerie silence of the house and the contrast between the living human world and the ghostly stillness within.\n\n(iv) The Traveller had come there to keep a promise he had made to someone. He says, 'Tell them I came, and no one answered, Tell them I kept my word.' This suggests he had promised to visit someone at this house but found only phantom listeners instead of living people.\n\n(v) The poem is 'The Listeners' and it was written by Walter de la Mare.",

      "question": "What were the traveller's words before he left? Why do you think he had come to this place?",
      "answer": "Before leaving, the Traveller called out loudly: 'Tell them I came, and no one answered, Tell them I kept my word.' These were his final words addressed to the phantom listeners inside the house. The Traveller had come to this place to fulfill a promise he had made to someone. Although the poem does not reveal who 'them' are or what the promise was, it is clear that the Traveller felt obligated to come despite the eerie atmosphere. He wanted whoever was meant to receive his visit to know that he had kept his word and come as promised, even though no one answered his knocking.",
