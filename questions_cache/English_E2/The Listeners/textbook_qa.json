      "id": "tl_tb_1f",
      "question": "1(f) Which word is repeated at the beginning and ending of the poem, and what impact does it have?",
      "answer": "The word 'silence' is repeated (implied through 'stillness' at the start and 'silence surged softly backward' at the end). Also, the question 'Is there anybody there?' is asked twice. This repetition creates a circular structure and emphasizes the eerie, unanswered nature of the Traveller's visit. The silence at the end mirrors the silence at the beginning, showing nothing has changed despite his visit.",

They are completely still.\n- Evidence: 'phantom listeners', 'host', 'dwelt in the lone house', 'never the least stir made the listeners'\n\n**'Them' (line 27):**\n- What we know: They are the people the Traveller made his promise to. They were expected to be at the house.

      "question": "2. What is the rhyme scheme of the poem?",
      "answer": "The poem has an irregular rhyme scheme. It does not follow a strict pattern like ABAB or ABCD throughout. The rhymes appear at irregular intervals - for example: 'door/floor', 'head/said', 'Traveller/still', 'eyes/listeners'. Some lines rhyme in couplets (AA), some in alternate lines (ABAB), and some don't rhyme at all. This irregular scheme creates a sense of unease and mystery that matches the poem's supernatural theme.",

      "answer": "a. This is a narrative poem written in the third person.\n\nThe poem tells a story (narrative) about a Traveller who visits a haunted house. It is written in the third person because the narrator refers to the main character as 'the Traveller', 'he', and 'his' rather than 'I' or 'we'. It is not a sonnet because it does not follow the 14-line sonnet structure.",

      "question": "4(a) Reference to Context: 'Where he stood perplexed and still.'\ni. Who is being described?\nii. Why is he perplexed?",
      "answer": "i. The Traveller is being described.\n\nii. He is perplexed (confused and puzzled) because he had come to the house expecting to meet someone, but no one answers his knocking. He called out 'Is there anybody there?' but received no response. Despite sensing that someone (or something) is there - 'he felt in his heart their strangeness' - no one comes down to greet him or even looks out the window ('No head from the leaf-fringed sill / Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes'). This lack of response to his visit, despite his promise to come, leaves him confused.",

      "question": "4(b) Reference to Context: 'But only a host of phantom listeners / That dwelt in the lone house then / Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight / To that voice from the world of men:'\ni. What could 'phantom listeners' refer to?\nii. How does the poet make the listeners seem like real people?\niii. Who is being referred to as 'that voice from the world of men'?",
      "answer": "i. 'Phantom listeners' could refer to ghosts or spirits who inhabit the house. They may be the souls of people who once lived there and have now died. They could also represent supernatural beings or the mysterious presence of the dead who remain connected to the house.\n\nii. The poet makes the listeners seem like real people by:\n- Describing them as 'standing' and 'thronging' (crowding together) on the stair\n- Saying they 'dwelt' (lived) in the house\n- Describing them as 'listening' and 'hearkening' (paying attention)\n- Noting that they heard 'every word' the Traveller spoke\n- Showing they were aware of his departure (heard his foot on the stirrup)\n\niii. 'That voice from the world of men' refers to the Traveller. He is the only living human ('the one man left awake') in this supernatural scene. His voice represents the living world calling out to the world of the dead/spirits.",

      "question": "Describe the setting of the poem in detail.",
      "answer": "The poem is set at night in a lonely house deep in a forest. The Traveller arrives on horseback at a house with a moonlit door. The forest floor is covered with ferns ('ferny floor'). The house has a turret (small tower), a dark staircase, and an empty hall. Moonlight enters the house, creating faint moonbeams on the dark stair. The setting is isolated, mysterious, and creates an eerie, supernatural atmosphere perfect for the ghostly inhabitants. The window has a 'leaf-fringed sill' suggesting overgrown vegetation. Outside, there is 'dark turf' and a 'starred and leafy sky'.",

      "question": "Who was the Traveller and what did he do at the deserted house?",
      "answer": "The Traveller was a mysterious visitor who arrived on horseback at a deserted house in the forest at night. He had apparently made a promise to someone to come to this house. At the house, he knocked on the moonlit door multiple times and called out 'Is there anybody there?' When he received no answer despite knocking 'louder' and 'smote upon the door again a second time', he left a message for the unseen listeners, saying 'Tell them I came, and no one answered, Tell them I kept my word.' Then he mounted his horse and rode away into the darkness.",

      "question": "Who were the 'listeners' in the poem? What details does the poet give about them?",
      "answer": "The listeners were phantom or ghostly beings who inhabited the lonely house. The poet provides several details about them: They were a 'host' (large number) of 'phantom listeners'. They 'dwelt' (lived) in the lone house. They stood 'thronging' (crowded together) on the dark stair in the faint moonbeams. They were completely still and silent - 'Never the least stir made the listeners'. They heard every word the Traveller spoke ('every word he spake fell echoing through the shadowiness'). They heard the sounds of his departure - his foot on the stirrup, the iron horseshoes on stone. Despite hearing everything, they never responded.",

    {
      "id": "tl_tb_extra_4",
      "question": "What was the Traveller's message for 'them'? What does this tell us about the Traveller?",
      "answer": "The Traveller's message was: 'Tell them I came, and no one answered, Tell them I kept my word.' This message tells us several things about the Traveller. First, he is honorable and keeps his promises - he came as he said he would, even to this eerie, deserted place. Second, he is persistent - he knocked multiple times despite getting no answer. Third, he wants the people he promised to know that he fulfilled his commitment. Fourth, there is something lonely and perhaps tragic about him - he keeps faith with people who cannot or will not respond. The message suggests a man of integrity who values honor above personal comfort.",

      "id": "tl_tb_extra_5",
      "question": "Explain the contrast between the human world and the supernatural world in the poem.",
      "answer": "The poem creates a striking contrast between the human world (the Traveller) and the supernatural world (the phantom listeners). The human world is characterized by sound and action - the Traveller knocks, calls out, his horse champed grass, we hear iron horseshoes on stone. The supernatural world is characterized by stillness and silence - the listeners make 'never the least stir.' The human world is visible and physical; the supernatural is invisible - the hall appears 'empty' though listeners are there. The Traveller is 'the one man left awake' - alive, conscious, active; the phantoms seem to exist in a different state of being. Yet despite this contrast, there is awareness between worlds - the Traveller senses 'their strangeness' and the listeners hear his every word. The final image of silence 'surging softly backward' after the Traveller leaves suggests the supernatural world is permanent while human presence is temporary.",

      "question": "What literary devices does Walter de la Mare use in this poem?",
      "answer": "Walter de la Mare uses several literary devices:\n1) Personification - 'silence surged softly backward' gives silence human qualities of movement. 'Stillness answering his cry' makes silence a responder.\n2) Alliteration - 'silence surged softly' (s sounds), 'ferny floor' (f sounds) creates musical effects.\n3) Imagery - vivid descriptions like 'moonlit door', 'ferny floor', 'dark stair', 'faint moonbeams' create visual pictures.\n4) Contrast - between sound/silence, human/supernatural, living/dead.\n5) Symbolism - moonlight symbolizes the boundary between worlds; the lone house represents isolation and mystery.\n6) Atmosphere - through careful word choice, creates an eerie, mysterious mood.\n7) Rhetorical question - 'Is there anybody there?' emphasizes the loneliness.\n8) Epithets - compound words like 'leaf-fringed' to describe the sill.",

      "id": "tl_tb_extra_7",
      "question": "What themes are explored in 'The Listeners'?",
      "answer": "The poem explores several profound themes:\n1) The Unknown/Unknowable: The poem suggests realms of existence beyond human perception - the spirit world we can sense but not see or understand.\n2) Loneliness and Isolation: The Traveller is 'the one man left awake,' alone among spirits. The lone house represents isolation.\n3) Keeping Promises and Honor: The Traveller fulfills his commitment despite receiving no acknowledgment.\n4) Communication Failure: The Traveller tries to reach the listeners but cannot - representing how we cannot truly communicate with the dead.\n5) Boundary Between Life and Death: The poem explores the divide between the living and dead - aware of each other but unable to interact.\n6) Memory and the Past: The house with its phantoms represents a place where something significant happened - the past lingers as ghosts.\n7) Mystery: The poem celebrates mystery itself, leaving questions unanswered.",
