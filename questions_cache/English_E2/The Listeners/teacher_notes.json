      "question": "What is the poem 'The Listeners' about? Give a brief summary.",
      "answer": "The poem describes a mysterious incident in which a traveller arrives at a deserted house in a forest at night. He knocks on the door and calls out, but no one answers. The atmosphere is eerie and silent. Although the house appears empty, it is actually inhabited by invisible, ghostly beings called \"Listeners.\"\n\nThese supernatural listeners silently hear the traveller's voice, footsteps, and the sound of his horse. They do not respond or reveal themselves. The traveller announces that he has kept a promise and has come as promised, but still receives no reply.\n\nAfter waiting, the traveller leaves the house and rides away into the darkness. The listeners continue to remain hidden, whispering among themselves about the lonely man who came and went without ever knowing they were there.\n\nThe poem creates a sense of mystery, loneliness, and the unknown, highlighting the contrast between the human world and the silent, unseen spirit world."

      "answer": "The traveller is alone in a dark forest, calling out to an empty house. His isolation is emphasized by the silence that greets him.

      "question": "What promise has the traveller kept? Why is this significant?",
      "answer": "The traveller says: \"Tell them I came, and no one answered, That I kept my word.\"\n\nThis shows themes of duty and honour. He has fulfilled his promise to come to this house, even though no one responds. We never learn what the promise was or to whom it was made, which adds to the mystery."

    {
      "id": "tn_listeners_5",
      "question": "What questions does the poem leave unanswered? Why?",
      "answer": "The poem leaves many questions unanswered:\n- Who are the listeners?\n- Who is the traveller?\n- What promise did he make?\n- Who are \"them\" he wants to tell?\n- Why is the house deserted?\n\nThis ambiguity is intentional - it adds to the poem's mysterious quality and makes readers think deeply about its meaning."

      "question": "How is personification used in 'The Listeners'?",
      "answer": "The silence is personified as something that can \"surge\" backward - as if it were a wave or a living thing.\n\nThe air is described as \"stirred and shaken\" by the traveller's call, as if it were a person being disturbed.\n\nThese give human qualities to non-living things and add to the eerie atmosphere."
