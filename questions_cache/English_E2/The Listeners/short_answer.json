      "question": "Who is the Traveller and why has he come to the house?",
      "answer": "The Traveller is a mysterious visitor who arrives on horseback at a deserted house in the forest at night. He has come to fulfill a promise he made to someone, as shown by his words 'Tell them I kept my word.' The identity of the Traveller and the exact nature of his promise are deliberately left mysterious by the poet.",
      "key_points": ["Mysterious visitor on horseback", "Came to keep a promise", "Identity deliberately mysterious"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_2",
      "question": "Describe the setting of the poem 'The Listeners'.",
      "answer": "The poem is set at night in a lonely house deep in a forest. The door is illuminated by moonlight, and the forest floor is covered with ferns ('ferny floor'). The house has a turret (small tower), dark stairs, and an empty hall. The setting creates an eerie, mysterious atmosphere suitable for the supernatural events.",
      "key_points": ["Night time", "Lonely house in forest", "Moonlit door", "Dark stairs and empty hall"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_3",
      "question": "Who are the 'listeners' in the poem?",
      "answer": "The listeners are phantom or ghostly beings who inhabit the lonely house. They are described as a 'host' (large number) of supernatural creatures who can hear the Traveller but remain invisible and silent. Though they hear every word he speaks, they make 'never the least stir' and never respond to his calls.",
      "key_points": ["Phantom/ghostly beings", "Large number (host)", "Invisible and silent", "Hear but don't respond"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_4",
      "question": "What message does the Traveller leave for 'them'?",
      "answer": "The Traveller asks the phantom listeners to tell 'them' that he came but no one answered, and that he kept his word by coming as he had promised. The identity of 'them' is never revealed, adding to the poem's mystery. The message shows the Traveller is an honorable person who values keeping his commitments.",
      "key_points": ["I came, no one answered", "I kept my word", "Identity of 'them' unknown"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_5",
      "question": "How do the listeners respond to the Traveller's knocking and calls?",
      "answer": "The listeners make no response at all to the Traveller. They stand silently in the moonlight on the dark stairs, and despite hearing every word he speaks, they make 'never the least stir.' Their stillness and silence is described as the only 'answer' to his cries - a response that is no response at all.",
      "key_points": ["No response", "Stand silently", "Hear but don't move", "Stillness is their only answer"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_6",
      "question": "What was the horse doing during the Traveller's visit?",
      "answer": "While the Traveller knocked on the door and called out, his horse stood quietly in the silence, champing (eating or chewing) the grasses on the ferny floor of the forest. The horse's ordinary behavior of eating grass contrasts with the eerie, supernatural atmosphere of the scene. The horse seems unaware of the strangeness that disturbs its master.",
      "key_points": ["Champing grass", "On ferny forest floor", "Contrasts with eerie atmosphere"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_7",
      "question": "What sounds are heard when the Traveller leaves?",
      "answer": "When the Traveller leaves, several sounds are heard: his foot stepping into the stirrup as he mounts his horse, the sound of the horse's iron horseshoes striking the stone path ('iron on stone'), and the plunging hoofs as the horse gallops away. After these sounds fade, the silence 'surges softly backward' to reclaim the space.",
      "key_points": ["Foot on stirrup", "Iron horseshoes on stone", "Plunging hoofs fading", "Silence returns"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_8",
      "question": "What does the phrase 'silence surged softly backward' mean?",
      "answer": "This phrase uses personification to describe how silence returned to the house after the Traveller left. The silence is portrayed as a living thing, like a wave that flows back once the sounds of the horse and rider fade away. It suggests the supernatural world is permanent while human presence is only temporary.",
      "key_points": ["Personification of silence", "Returns like a wave", "Supernatural world is permanent"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_9",
      "question": "How does the Traveller sense the presence of the listeners?",
      "answer": "The Traveller senses the listeners through intuition rather than physical sight or sound - 'he felt in his heart their strangeness.' Even though he cannot see or hear them, he can feel that something unusual and supernatural is present in the house. This inner awareness tells him he is not truly alone.",
      "key_points": ["Through intuition", "Felt in his heart", "Cannot see them", "Senses strangeness"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_10",
      "question": "What mood or atmosphere does the poem create?",
      "answer": "The poem creates an atmosphere of mystery, eeriness, and loneliness. The moonlit setting, deserted house, phantom listeners, and unanswered calls all contribute to a sense of the supernatural and the unknown. The pervasive silence and the contrast between the living Traveller and the unseen phantoms add to the eerie mood.",
      "key_points": ["Mystery and eeriness", "Loneliness", "Supernatural atmosphere", "Pervasive silence"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_11",
      "question": "What contrast does the poem highlight?",
      "answer": "The poem highlights the contrast between the human world and the spirit or supernatural world. The living Traveller, with his noise and physical presence, contrasts sharply with the silent, invisible phantom listeners. The human world is characterized by sound and action, while the supernatural world is defined by stillness and silence.",
      "key_points": ["Human vs spirit world", "Sound vs silence", "Visible vs invisible", "Action vs stillness"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_12",
      "question": "Where were the phantom listeners standing?",
      "answer": "The phantom listeners were standing crowded together ('thronging') on the dark staircase of the house, in the faint moonbeams that entered through windows. The stairs led down to the empty hall below. Though many phantoms gathered there, the hall appeared empty because they were invisible to human eyes.",
      "key_points": ["On dark staircase", "Crowded together", "In faint moonbeams", "Hall appeared empty"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_13",
      "question": "What does 'the one man left awake' suggest about the Traveller?",
      "answer": "The phrase 'the one man left awake' suggests that the Traveller is the only living, conscious human being in that eerie place. It emphasizes his profound loneliness and isolation among the ghostly inhabitants. The word 'awake' also contrasts with the phantom listeners who exist in a state that is neither fully alive nor conscious.",
      "key_points": ["Only living human", "Emphasizes loneliness", "Contrasts with phantoms", "Isolation among ghosts"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_14",
      "question": "What does the Traveller's message reveal about his character?",
      "answer": "The Traveller's message reveals that he is an honorable person who values keeping promises. Despite receiving no answer and facing an eerie supernatural situation, he came as he said he would. He is persistent, brave, and determined to fulfill his commitment regardless of whether anyone acknowledges it.",
      "key_points": ["Honorable", "Keeps promises", "Persistent and brave", "Fulfills commitment"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_15",
      "question": "Why is the hall described as 'empty' when the listeners are there?",
      "answer": "The hall is described as 'empty' because the phantom listeners are invisible to human eyes. Though many ghosts are present, crowded on the stairs and filling the space, a living person would see only an empty hall. This contradiction emphasizes the supernatural nature of the listeners who exist but cannot be seen.",
      "key_points": ["Listeners invisible", "Many present but unseen", "Supernatural nature", "Empty to human eyes"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_16",
      "question": "What happened when the Traveller knocked the first time?",
      "answer": "When the Traveller first knocked on the moonlit door and asked 'Is there anybody there?', a bird flew out of the turret above his head, startled by the noise. However, no human or speaking creature answered his call. The silence continued, and no one descended to greet him or looked out the window.",
      "key_points": ["Bird flew from turret", "No human answer", "Silence continued", "No one descended"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_17",
      "question": "What is the significance of moonlight in the poem?",
      "answer": "Moonlight in the poem creates an eerie, supernatural atmosphere and suggests the boundary between the natural and spirit worlds. It illuminates the door ('moonlit door') and creates faint beams inside the house where the phantoms stand. Moonlight traditionally symbolizes mystery, the unknown, and the realm of the supernatural in literature.",
      "key_points": ["Creates eerie atmosphere", "Suggests supernatural", "Illuminates scene", "Symbolizes mystery"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_18",
      "question": "Why is the house called 'lone'?",
      "answer": "The house is called 'lone' (lonely or solitary) because it stands isolated in the forest, far from other human habitation. This isolation explains why only phantoms, not living people, now occupy it. The word also creates a sense of abandonment and suggests something sad and forgotten about the place.",
      "key_points": ["Isolated in forest", "Far from other houses", "Only phantoms live there", "Suggests abandonment"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_19",
      "question": "What does 'host of phantom listeners' tell us about their number?",
      "answer": "The word 'host' means a large number or multitude, so 'host of phantom listeners' tells us there were many ghostly beings in the house. It was not just one or two ghosts, but a crowd of them. This large number makes the supernatural presence even more powerful and the Traveller's isolation more profound.",
      "key_points": ["Host means many", "Large number of ghosts", "More than one or two", "Powerful supernatural presence"]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_sa_20",
      "question": "How does the poem end?",
      "answer": "The poem ends with the Traveller mounting his horse and riding away into the darkness. The phantom listeners hear the sounds of his departure - foot on stirrup, iron horseshoes on stone, and plunging hoofs. Then silence 'surges softly backward,' returning to claim the house once the living visitor is gone.",
      "key_points": ["Traveller rides away", "Listeners hear departure", "Silence returns", "Living visitor gone"]
