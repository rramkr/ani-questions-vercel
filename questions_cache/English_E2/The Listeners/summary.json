      "question": "Summary of The Listeners (Walter de la Mare)",
      "answer": "The poem describes a mysterious incident in which a traveller arrives at a deserted house in a forest at night. He knocks on the door and calls out, but no one answers. The atmosphere is eerie and silent.\n\nAlthough the house appears empty, it is actually inhabited by invisible, ghostly beings called \"Listeners.\" These supernatural listeners silently hear the traveller's voice, footsteps, and the sound of his horse. They do not respond or reveal themselves.\n\nThe traveller announces that he has kept a promise and has come as promised, but still receives no reply. After waiting, the traveller leaves the house and rides away into the darkness.\n\nThe listeners continue to remain hidden, whispering among themselves about the lonely man who came and went without ever knowing they were there.\n\nThe poem creates a sense of mystery, loneliness, and the unknown, highlighting the contrast between the human world and the silent, unseen spirit world."
