      "question": "Reference to Context: ''Is there anybody there?' said the Traveller, Knocking on the moonlit door;'\n\n(i) Who is the Traveller?\n(ii) Where is this scene set?\n(iii) What does 'moonlit door' suggest about the time and atmosphere?",
      "answer": "(i) The Traveller is a mysterious visitor who has arrived on horseback at a deserted house in the forest. He is called 'the one man left awake' - emphasizing that he is the only living, conscious human in this eerie place. He has apparently come to fulfill a promise he made to someone.\n\n(ii) The scene is set at a lonely house deep in a forest at night. The forest floor is covered with ferns ('ferny floor'), and the house has a turret (small tower), dark stairs, and an empty hall. The setting is isolated and mysterious.\n\n(iii) 'Moonlit door' tells us the scene takes place at night, with moonlight illuminating the entrance. This creates an eerie, supernatural atmosphere. Moonlight traditionally symbolizes mystery and the boundary between the natural and spirit worlds, which is fitting for a poem about phantom listeners.",

      "answer": "(i) The horse was standing in the silence, champing (chewing or eating) the grasses. While its master knocked and called out at the mysterious house, the horse simply ate grass, unconcerned with the eerie atmosphere.\n\n(ii) The 'ferny floor' refers to the forest ground covered with ferns - a type of leafy plant that grows in shady, moist areas. It tells us the house is located deep in a wild, overgrown forest, far from civilization.\n\n(iii) The horse's ordinary behavior of eating grass creates a contrast with the supernatural, eerie atmosphere of the scene. While the Traveller senses something strange and keeps knocking urgently, the horse is unaware of any danger or mystery. This contrast highlights how the supernatural elements affect only the conscious human observer, not the innocent animal.",

      "question": "Reference to Context: 'But only a host of phantom listeners That dwelt in the lone house then Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight'\n\n(i) Who are the 'phantom listeners'?\n(ii) What does 'host' suggest about their number?\n(iii) What does 'dwelt' tell us about them?",
      "answer": "(i) The phantom listeners are ghostly or supernatural beings who inhabit the lonely house. They are spirits or ghosts who can hear the Traveller but remain invisible and silent. They represent the spirit world that exists alongside our human world but remains hidden from us.\n\n(ii) 'Host' means a large number or multitude. It suggests there were many phantom listeners in the house, not just one or two ghosts. The house was filled with these supernatural beings, crowded together on the dark stair, making the ghostly presence even more powerful.\n\n(iii) 'Dwelt' means lived or resided. It tells us the phantom listeners lived permanently in this house - it was their dwelling place. Unlike the Traveller who is just passing through, the phantoms belong there and will remain after he leaves.",

      "answer": "(i) 'Thronging' means crowding together in large numbers. It tells us the phantom listeners were gathered closely together, packed on the staircase in the dim moonlight. This reinforces that there was a 'host' (many) of them.\n\n(ii) The listeners were standing on the dark staircase of the house, in the faint moonbeams that entered through windows. The stairs led down to the hall below. They were inside the house, invisible to the Traveller outside.\n\n(iii) The hall is described as 'empty' because the phantom listeners are invisible to human eyes. Though many ghosts are present, crowded on the stairs and filling the space, a living person would see only an empty hall. This paradox - full yet empty - emphasizes the supernatural nature of the listeners who exist but cannot be seen.",

      "question": "Reference to Context: 'And he felt in his heart their strangeness, Their stillness answering his cry'\n\n(i) What did the Traveller feel?\n(ii) How did he sense the presence of the listeners?\n(iii) What is meant by 'stillness answering his cry'?",
      "answer": "(i) The Traveller felt the strangeness of the unseen listeners. Even though he couldn't see or hear them, he could sense intuitively that something unusual and supernatural was present in the house. He felt this strangeness 'in his heart' - through inner awareness.\n\n(ii) He sensed the listeners through intuition rather than his physical senses. He couldn't see them (they were invisible) or hear them (they made no sound), but he could feel their presence. This suggests a connection between the human and spirit worlds that operates beyond normal perception.\n\n(iii) 'Stillness answering his cry' is an oxymoron - a contradiction in terms. Normally, an answer involves sound or action, but here the only 'answer' to the Traveller's calls was complete silence and lack of movement. The listeners' refusal to respond, their utter stillness, was paradoxically the only response he received.",

      "answer": "(i) The Traveller is speaking, addressing his message to the phantom listeners inside the house. He asks these unseen beings to pass on his message to 'them' - the mysterious people he had promised to visit.\n\n(ii) The Traveller leaves a simple but significant message: that he came but no one answered the door, and that he kept his word by coming as he had promised. He wants 'them' to know he fulfilled his commitment.\n\n(iii) This message reveals several things about the Traveller's character: He is honorable and values keeping promises - despite the eerie situation, he came as he said he would. He is persistent - he knocked multiple times before leaving. He has a sense of duty - he feels obligated to report that he fulfilled his promise. There is also something lonely and perhaps tragic about him - he keeps faith with people who cannot or will not respond.",

      "question": "Reference to Context: 'Never the least stir made the listeners, Though every word he spake Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house.'\n\n(i) How did the listeners respond to the Traveller?\n(ii) What does 'spake' mean?\n(iii) What is 'shadowiness' and what mood does it create?",
      "answer": "(i) The listeners made absolutely no response - 'never the least stir.' They remained completely silent and motionless despite hearing every word the Traveller spoke. Even the smallest movement would have been 'a stir,' but they made none at all.\n\n(ii) 'Spake' is an archaic (old-fashioned) past tense of 'speak' - it means 'spoke.' Using this old word gives the poem a timeless, mysterious quality and connects it to traditional English poetry.\n\n(iii) 'Shadowiness' refers to the darkness and shadows filling the house interior. It creates a mood of mystery, gloom, and the supernatural. The word suggests a place where light cannot fully penetrate, where secrets remain hidden, and where the boundary between the visible and invisible worlds is blurred.",

      "answer": "(i) 'Ay' means 'yes' - it is an old-fashioned or dialectal word expressing agreement or confirmation. Here it emphasizes that yes, the listeners definitely heard the sounds of the Traveller's departure.\n\n(ii) The listeners heard two specific sounds as the Traveller left: his foot stepping into the stirrup as he mounted his horse, and the sound of the horse's iron horseshoes striking the stone path as he began to ride away.\n\n(iii) 'Iron on stone' refers to the sound of the horse's iron horseshoes striking the stone surface of the path or road. Horseshoes were traditionally made of iron, and this would create a distinctive, sharp, ringing sound when striking hard stone. This detail makes the scene vivid and realistic.",

      "answer": "(i) 'Silence surged' uses personification - giving human or living qualities to silence, which is abstract and non-living. Silence is described as if it were a wave that could 'surge' or flow, as if it were alive and had the ability to move.\n\n(ii) This phrase describes how silence returned to the house after the Traveller left. Once the sounds of his departure faded - his foot on stirrup, horseshoes on stone, galloping hoofs - the silence flowed back like a wave to fill the space. It suggests the supernatural world of silence reclaiming its territory after the brief human intrusion.\n\n(iii) 'Plunging hoofs' describes the horse's hooves striking the ground forcefully as it galloped away quickly into the darkness. The word 'plunging' suggests rapid, powerful movement - the horse was moving fast and forcefully as the Traveller rode away from the mysterious house.",

      "answer": "(i) A turret is a small tower, usually at the corner of a building or castle. It suggests the house is old and possibly once grand, adding to its Gothic, mysterious quality. The presence of a turret indicates this is no ordinary cottage but a substantial, perhaps once-noble building.\n\n(ii) The bird flew out because it was startled by the Traveller's knocking on the door. The sudden noise disturbed the bird that had been roosting peacefully in the turret. This detail also suggests the house has been abandoned so long that birds now live in its towers.\n\n(iii) No, the bird's flight is not a meaningful response to the Traveller's question 'Is there anybody there?' It is merely a startled animal reacting to noise. The irony is that the only living creature to respond to his presence is a bird, not any human or speaking being. This emphasizes the eerie abandonment of the house.",

      "answer": "(i) 'Smote' is the past tense of 'smite,' meaning to strike or hit forcefully. It is an archaic word that suggests hitting with force. The Traveller knocked hard on the door, not just tapped gently - showing his determination to get a response.\n\n(ii) The Traveller knocked louder because he had received no answer to his previous knocks. His increasing force shows his determination and perhaps frustration. Despite sensing something strange about the place, he was persistent in trying to fulfill his promise and get a response.\n\n(iii) He lifted his head perhaps to look up at the windows or turret, hoping to see someone watching. It also suggests defiance and determination - he was not intimidated by the eerie silence. Lifting one's head is a gesture of assertiveness, showing he would not be cowed by the supernatural atmosphere.",

      "answer": "(i) 'The one man left awake' refers to the Traveller. He is the only living, conscious human being in this eerie place, surrounded by phantom listeners who exist in a different state.\n\n(ii) This phrase suggests that the listeners are not 'awake' in the human sense - they are phantoms, ghosts who exist in a state that is neither fully alive nor conscious. While they can hear, they cannot respond. They are like sleepers or the dead, present but not truly alive.\n\n(iii) Being 'awake' is significant because it emphasizes the Traveller's living, conscious state in contrast to the supernatural beings around him. It highlights his profound loneliness and isolation - he is the only conscious being in a place full of silent spirits. The word also suggests that the spirit world is like an eternal sleep from which the phantoms cannot wake to respond.",
