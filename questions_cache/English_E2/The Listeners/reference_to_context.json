      "extract": "Their stillness answering his cry.",
      "question": "What is the significance of 'stillness answering'?",
      "answer": "The phrase 'stillness answering his cry' is an oxymoron - stillness (silence) is the only response to the Traveller's calls. It suggests that the listeners' refusal to respond is itself a kind of answer, highlighting the eerie silence.",

      "question": "What mood does 'shadowiness' and 'still' create?",
      "answer": "The words 'shadowiness' and 'still' create a mood of mystery, silence, and eeriness. Shadows suggest darkness and hidden things, while stillness emphasizes the unnatural quiet of the haunted house.",

    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_19",
      "extract": "How the silence surged softly backward.",
      "question": "What is meant by 'silence surged softly backward'?",
      "answer": "This phrase personifies silence, making it seem like a living thing that flows back like a wave after the Traveller leaves. It suggests that the silence is powerful and returns to claim the space once the human sounds (footsteps, horseshoes) are gone.",
      "justification": "The personification of silence 'surging' creates a sense of its overwhelming presence."
    },

      "extract": "A host of phantom listeners.",
      "question": "What does 'host' suggest about the number of listeners?",

      "extract": "Stood thronging the faint moonbeams.",
      "question": "What does 'thronging' tell us about the listeners?",

      "id": "tl_rtc_24",
      "extract": "The empty hall.",
      "question": "Why is the hall described as 'empty' when listeners are present?",
      "answer": "The hall is described as 'empty' because the phantom listeners are invisible and intangible. Though they are present, they cannot be seen by the living, so to human eyes the hall appears completely empty.",
      "justification": "The contrast between 'empty' hall and present listeners emphasizes their ghostly nature."
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_25",
      "extract": "He felt in his heart their strangeness.",
      "question": "How did the Traveller sense the listeners without seeing them?",
      "answer": "The Traveller sensed the listeners through intuition - he 'felt in his heart' their presence. Even without seeing or hearing them, he could feel something strange and unusual about the place, suggesting a supernatural awareness.",
      "justification": "The extract shows intuitive sensing 'in his heart' rather than physical perception."
