          "question": "(i) Who is the Traveller and what is he doing?",
          "answer": "The Traveller is a mysterious visitor who has arrived at a deserted house in the forest at night. He is knocking on the door, which is illuminated by moonlight, and calling out to ask if anyone is inside."

          "answer": "While the Traveller knocked on the door, his horse stood quietly in the silence, champing (chewing or eating) the grasses on the ferny floor of the forest."

          "question": "(iii) What does 'moonlit door' suggest about the setting?",
          "answer": "The phrase 'moonlit door' suggests that the scene takes place at night, with moonlight illuminating the door. This creates an eerie, mysterious atmosphere and hints at something supernatural."

        {
          "question": "(iv) What is the 'ferny floor'?",
          "answer": "The 'ferny floor' refers to the forest ground covered with ferns (a type of leafy plant). It tells us the house is located deep in a wild, overgrown forest, adding to the isolated and mysterious setting."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) What mood is created in these lines?",
          "answer": "These lines create a mood of mystery, loneliness, and suspense. The dark forest, moonlit door, silence, and unanswered question all combine to suggest something eerie and supernatural is about to happen."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_2",
      "extract": "And he smote upon the door again a second time;\n'Is there anybody there?' he said.\nBut no one descended to the Traveller;\nNo head from the leaf-fringed sill\nLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) What does 'smote' mean?",
          "answer": "'Smote' is the past tense of 'smite,' meaning to strike or knock forcefully. The Traveller hit the door hard because he received no answer the first time and was becoming more urgent in his attempts."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) Why did the Traveller knock a second time?",
          "answer": "The Traveller knocked a second time because no one had answered his first knock. He was persistent in trying to get a response, perhaps because he had made a promise to come here and needed to fulfill it."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) What does 'no one descended' tell us about the house?",
          "answer": "'No one descended' tells us the house has an upper floor with stairs. It suggests someone should have come down the stairs to answer the door, but nobody did - emphasizing the emptiness and mystery."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What is meant by 'leaf-fringed sill'?",
          "answer": "The 'leaf-fringed sill' refers to the window ledge surrounded or decorated by leaves. This suggests the house is overgrown with vegetation, indicating it has been abandoned or neglected for some time."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) Why are the Traveller's eyes described as 'grey'?",
          "answer": "The grey eyes might suggest the Traveller is middle-aged or elderly, or they could reflect the grey, dim light of the moonlit night. Grey eyes also add to the mysterious, otherworldly quality of the character."
        }

    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_3",
      "extract": "But only a host of phantom listeners\nThat dwelt in the lone house then\nStood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\nTo that voice from the world of men.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) Who are the 'phantom listeners'?",
          "answer": "The phantom listeners are ghostly or supernatural beings who inhabit the lonely house. They are spirits or ghosts who can hear but cannot or will not respond to the living Traveller."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) What does 'host' suggest about the number of listeners?",
          "answer": "'Host' means a large number or multitude. It suggests there were many phantom listeners in the house, not just one or two ghosts, making the supernatural presence even more powerful."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) What does 'the lone house' tell us about the setting?",
          "answer": "'The lone house' tells us the house stands isolated and solitary, far from other human habitation. This isolation explains why only phantoms, not living people, now occupy it."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What is significant about 'that voice from the world of men'?",
          "answer": "This phrase emphasizes the contrast between the human world (the Traveller) and the spirit world (the phantoms). The Traveller belongs to the living world, while the listeners belong to a different realm entirely."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_4",
      "extract": "Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\nThat goes down to the empty hall,\nHearkening in an air stirred and shaken\nBy the lonely Traveller's call.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) What does 'thronging' mean and what does it tell us?",
          "answer": "'Thronging' means crowding together in large numbers. It tells us many phantom listeners were gathered closely together on the staircase in the dim moonlight, reinforcing that there was a host of them."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) Why is the stair described as 'dark'?",
          "answer": "The stair is described as dark because very little moonlight reaches the interior of the house. The darkness adds to the mysterious, eerie atmosphere and suggests hidden, unseen things on the stairs."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) Why is the hall described as 'empty' when the listeners are present?",
          "answer": "The hall is described as 'empty' because the phantom listeners are invisible to human eyes. Though many ghosts are present, a living person would see the hall as completely empty."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What does 'hearkening' mean?",
          "answer": "'Hearkening' means listening attentively or paying close attention to sounds. The phantom listeners were carefully listening to every word and sound made by the Traveller outside."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) What effect did the Traveller's call have on the air?",
          "answer": "The Traveller's call 'stirred and shaken' the air inside the house. His voice broke the stillness and disturbed the silence, though the phantoms themselves remained motionless in response."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_5",
      "extract": "And he felt in his heart their strangeness,\nTheir stillness answering his cry,\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\nLouder, and lifted his head.",

        {
          "question": "(i) What did the Traveller feel 'in his heart'?",
          "answer": "The Traveller felt the strangeness of the unseen listeners in his heart. Though he couldn't see them, he sensed intuitively that something unusual and supernatural was present in the house."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) What is meant by 'stillness answering his cry'?",
          "answer": "'Stillness answering his cry' is an oxymoron - the only response to the Traveller's calls was silence itself. The complete lack of movement or sound from the listeners was their only 'answer' to him."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) Why did the Traveller knock 'even louder'?",
          "answer": "The Traveller knocked louder out of frustration and determination. Despite sensing something strange, he was persistent in trying to get a response, perhaps because he needed to fulfill an important promise."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) Why did he lift his head?",
          "answer": "He lifted his head perhaps to look up at the windows or turret, hoping to see someone. It also suggests defiance and determination - he refused to give up despite the eerie silence."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_6",
      "extract": "'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\nTell them I kept my word,' said he.\nNever the least stir made the listeners,\nThough every word he spake\nFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) What message did the Traveller leave?",
          "answer": "The Traveller asked the unseen listeners to tell 'them' that he came but no one answered, and that he kept his word by coming as promised. He wanted it known that he had fulfilled his commitment."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) Who are 'them' that the Traveller refers to?",
          "answer": "'Them' refers to the people the Traveller had made a promise to visit. Their identity is deliberately left mysterious - they could be former inhabitants now dead, or people elsewhere expecting news from this visit."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) What does 'I kept my word' tell us about the Traveller?",
          "answer": "'I kept my word' tells us the Traveller is an honorable person who values keeping promises. Despite the eerie circumstances and lack of response, he came as he had promised he would."

        {
          "question": "(iv) How did the listeners respond to his message?",
          "answer": "The listeners made absolutely no response - 'never the least stir.' They remained completely silent and motionless even though they heard every word he spoke echoing through the shadowy house."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) What is 'shadowiness' and what mood does it create?",
          "answer": "'Shadowiness' refers to the darkness and shadows filling the house. It creates a mood of mystery, gloom, and the supernatural - a place where light cannot fully penetrate and secrets remain hidden."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_7",
      "extract": "Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\nAnd the sound of iron on stone,\nAnd how the silence surged softly backward,\nWhen the plunging hoofs were gone.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) What sounds did the listeners hear as the Traveller left?",
          "answer": "The listeners heard the Traveller's foot stepping into the stirrup as he mounted his horse, and the sound of the horse's iron horseshoes striking the stone path as he rode away."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) What is 'iron on stone'?",
          "answer": "'Iron on stone' refers to the sound of the horse's iron horseshoes striking the stone surface of the path or road. This was a distinctive, sharp sound as the horse began to move away."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) What does 'the silence surged softly backward' mean?",
          "answer": "This phrase personifies silence, describing how it returned to fill the space after the Traveller left. Like a wave flowing back, the silence reclaimed the house once the sounds of departure faded."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What are 'plunging hoofs'?",
          "answer": "'Plunging hoofs' describes the horse's hooves striking the ground forcefully as it galloped away quickly. The word 'plunging' suggests rapid, powerful movement into the darkness."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) What is the significance of the silence returning?",
          "answer": "The silence returning suggests the supernatural world is permanent while human presence is temporary. Once the living Traveller left, the eternal quiet of the phantom-inhabited house reclaimed everything."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_8",
      "extract": "And a bird flew up out of the turret,\nAbove the Traveller's head:\nAnd he smote upon the door again a second time;\n'Is there anybody there?' he said.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) What is a turret?",
          "answer": "A turret is a small tower, usually at the corner of a building or castle. It suggests the house is old and possibly grand, adding to its Gothic, mysterious quality."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) Why did the bird fly out?",
          "answer": "The bird flew out because it was startled by the Traveller's knocking on the door. The sudden noise disturbed the bird that had been roosting peacefully in the turret."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) Is the bird's flight a response to the Traveller's question?",
          "answer": "No, the bird's flight is not a meaningful response - it's just a natural reaction to being startled. It emphasizes that only the bird, not any human or speaking creature, reacted to the Traveller's presence."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What does this incident add to the atmosphere?",
          "answer": "The bird flying out adds to the eerie, abandoned atmosphere. It shows the house is so neglected that birds live in its turret, and the only living creature to respond is a startled bird, not a person."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_9",
      "extract": "From the one man left awake.\nFor he suddenly smote on the door, even\nLouder, and lifted his head:\n'Tell them I came, and no one answered,\nTell them I kept my word,' said he.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) What does 'the one man left awake' mean?",
          "answer": "This phrase means the Traveller was the only living, conscious human being in that eerie place. It emphasizes his loneliness and isolation among the phantom inhabitants who exist in a different state."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) Why is the word 'awake' significant?",
          "answer": "'Awake' contrasts with the phantom listeners who are not truly alive or conscious in the human sense. The Traveller is awake and aware, while the phantoms exist in a state like eternal sleep or death."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) Why did the Traveller knock 'even louder'?",
          "answer": "The Traveller knocked louder because he was determined to get a response and fulfill his promise. Despite the eerie silence and sensing something strange, he refused to give up easily."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What does lifting his head suggest?",
          "answer": "Lifting his head suggests defiance, determination, and perhaps a final appeal to anyone who might be watching from above. It shows he is not intimidated by the supernatural atmosphere."
        },
        {
          "question": "(v) Why does he repeat his message about keeping his word?",
          "answer": "He repeats his message because it is important to him that whoever 'they' are know he fulfilled his commitment. His honor and integrity matter to him, even without any acknowledgment from the silent house."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tl_rtc_10",
      "extract": "Where he stood perplexed and still.\nAnd his horse in the silence champed the grasses\nOf the forest's ferny floor.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "(i) Why was the Traveller 'perplexed'?",
          "answer": "The Traveller was perplexed (confused and puzzled) because he expected someone to answer but received only silence. He sensed something strange about the place but couldn't understand why no one responded."
        },
        {
          "question": "(ii) Why did he stand 'still'?",
          "answer": "He stood still, waiting and listening for any response to his knocking and calling. The stillness shows his patience and determination to wait for an answer before giving up."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iii) What contrast is shown between the Traveller and his horse?",
          "answer": "The contrast shows the Traveller is troubled and confused while his horse is unconcerned, simply eating grass. The horse is unaware of the supernatural atmosphere that disturbs its master."
        },
        {
          "question": "(iv) What is the effect of repeating the image of the horse and 'ferny floor'?",
          "answer": "The repetition creates a sense of time passing while nothing changes - the Traveller waits, the horse eats, but no answer comes. It also frames the poem with the same peaceful forest image despite the eerie events."
