      "answer": "Two rules to find poles of an electromagnet:\n\n**1. Right-Hand Thumb Rule (Solenoid Rule):**\n- Curl your RIGHT hand fingers in the direction the current flows through the coil windings\n- Your extended THUMB points towards the NORTH POLE\n\n**2. Clock Rule (End-On View):**\n- Look directly at one end of the electromagnet\n- If current flows ANTICLOCKWISE at that end → NORTH pole\n- If current flows CLOCKWISE at that end → SOUTH pole\n- Memory tip: 'aNti' has 'N' for North, 'clockwiSe' has 'S' for South",

      "answer": "**Answer: Left end = SOUTH (S), Right end = NORTH (N)**\n\n**Step-by-step solution using Right-Hand Thumb Rule:**\n\n1. **Current direction:** Current flows from + (right) to - (left) through the external circuit.\n\n2. **Inside the coil:** Arrows show current flowing UPWARD on the front face. This means current flows DOWNWARD on the back face.\n\n3. **Apply Right-Hand Thumb Rule:**\n   - Curl your right-hand fingers in the direction of current (UP at front, DOWN at back)\n   - Fingers wrap from left to right when viewed from above\n   - Your THUMB points to the RIGHT\n\n4. **Conclusion:** RIGHT end = NORTH pole (N), LEFT end = SOUTH pole (S)\n\n**Verification using Clock Rule:**\n- Looking at LEFT end: current flows clockwise → South pole ✓\n- Looking at RIGHT end: current flows anticlockwise → North pole ✓",

      "question": "What happens to the poles of an electromagnet if you reverse the battery connections (swap + and -)?",
      "answer": "**Answer: The North and South poles get REVERSED/EXCHANGED.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **When battery is reversed:**\n   - Current now flows in the OPPOSITE direction through the coil\n   - The direction of current through each winding is reversed\n\n2. **Effect on poles:**\n   - Using Right-Hand Thumb Rule with reversed current:\n   - Your fingers now curl in the opposite direction\n   - Therefore, your thumb points in the opposite direction\n   - The end that was NORTH becomes SOUTH\n   - The end that was SOUTH becomes NORTH\n\n3. **Example:**\n   - Original: Left = N, Right = S\n   - After reversing battery: Left = S, Right = N\n\n**This is a KEY ADVANTAGE of electromagnets:**\n- Polarity can be easily reversed (unlike permanent magnets)\n- Used in applications like electric motors, relays, and speakers",
