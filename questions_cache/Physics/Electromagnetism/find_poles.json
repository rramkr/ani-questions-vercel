      "answer": "Two rules to find poles of an electromagnet:\n\n**1. Right-Hand Thumb Rule (Solenoid Rule):**\n- Curl your RIGHT hand fingers in the direction the current flows through the coil windings\n- Your extended THUMB points towards the NORTH POLE\n\n**2. Clock Rule (End-On View):**\n- Look directly at one end of the electromagnet\n- If current flows ANTICLOCKWISE at that end → NORTH pole\n- If current flows CLOCKWISE at that end → SOUTH pole\n- Memory tip: 'aNti' has 'N' for North, 'clockwiSe' has 'S' for South",
