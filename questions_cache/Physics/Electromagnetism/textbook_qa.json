      "question": "What is an electromagnet? How is it different from a permanent magnet?",
      "answer": "An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which a magnetic field is produced through electric current. It consists of a soft iron core with insulated copper wire wound around it.\n\nDifferences from permanent magnet:\n1. Electromagnet is temporary - loses magnetism when current stops; permanent magnet retains magnetism\n2. Electromagnet uses soft materials; permanent magnet uses hard materials\n3. Electromagnet strength can be controlled; permanent magnet has fixed strength\n4. Electromagnet can be switched on/off; permanent magnet cannot be controlled",

      "question": "What are the two types of electromagnets based on shape?",
      "answer": "Based on shape, electromagnets are of two types:\n1. Bar-shaped electromagnet: Insulated copper wire is wrapped around a bar-shaped soft iron core\n2. U-shaped electromagnet: Insulated copper wire is wrapped around a U-shaped soft iron core\n\nIn both types, the wire ends are connected to a battery through a switch to control the current flow.",

      "answer": "To make an electromagnet:\n1. Take an iron nail and insulated copper wire\n2. Remove plastic coating from both ends of the wire\n3. Wrap the wire tightly around the iron nail in a coil\n4. Connect the two free ends of the wire to a battery terminals with a switch in between\n5. Turn the switch on to allow current to flow\n\nWhen current flows, the iron nail becomes magnetized and can attract paper clips at its ends. When switch is off, it loses magnetism.",

      "question": "List the factors on which the strength of an electromagnet depends.",
      "answer": "The strength of an electromagnet depends on two main factors:\n\n1. Amount of current flowing through the coil: More current makes the electromagnet stronger; less current makes it weaker. Strength is directly proportional to current.\n\n2. Number of turns per unit length of the coil: More turns make the electromagnet stronger; fewer turns make it weaker. Strength is directly proportional to number of turns.",

      "question": "How is the strength of an electromagnet related to the amount of current flowing through it?",
      "answer": "The strength of an electromagnet is directly proportional to the amount of electric current flowing through it. This means:\n- As current increases, the electromagnet becomes stronger\n- As current decreases, the electromagnet becomes weaker\n- When current is zero (switched off), the electromagnet loses all magnetism",

This means:\n- If the number of turns is increased, the electromagnet becomes stronger\n- If the number of turns is decreased, the electromagnet becomes weaker\n- More turns allow more magnetic field lines to be created, increasing magnetic strength",

      "question": "Describe the construction and working of an electric bell.",
      "answer": "Construction: An electric bell has an electromagnet, contact spring, contact screw, armature (iron), hammer, and gong fitted on wooden/plastic board. Terminals T1 and T2 connect to battery through push button switch.\n\nWorking: When push button is pressed, current flows through electromagnet, magnetizing it. It attracts iron armature, causing hammer to hit gong (producing sound). This movement breaks contact with contact screw, stopping current. Electromagnet loses magnetism, spring pulls armature back, restoring contact. Cycle repeats continuously while button is pressed.",

      "question": "How does the end of an electromagnet where current flows clockwise behave - as north pole or south pole?",
      "answer": "The end of an electromagnet where the current flows in a clockwise direction acts as the south pole. Conversely, the end where the current flows in an anticlockwise direction acts as the north pole. This rule helps identify the poles of an electromagnet based on the direction of current flow.",

      "id": "tq011",
      "question": "Why is soft iron used as the core of an electromagnet instead of steel?",
      "answer": "Soft iron is used because:\n1. It easily gets magnetized when current flows through the coil\n2. It quickly loses its magnetism when current is switched off\n3. This makes the electromagnet a controllable temporary magnet\n\nSteel is not suitable because it is a hard material that retains magnetism even after current stops, making it impossible to control the magnet by switching current on and off.",

    {
      "id": "tq012",
      "question": "What happens to an electromagnet when the current is switched off?",
      "answer": "When the current is switched off, the electromagnet immediately loses its magnetism. The soft iron core, which was behaving like a magnet due to the current flowing through the coil, returns to being an ordinary piece of iron. It can no longer attract magnetic materials. This is why electromagnets are called temporary magnets.",

      "id": "tq013",
      "question": "In an electric bell, what causes the hammer to keep striking the gong repeatedly?",
      "answer": "The hammer keeps striking repeatedly due to the make-and-break mechanism:\n1. When current flows, electromagnet attracts armature, hammer hits gong\n2. Armature movement breaks contact with contact screw, stopping current\n3. Electromagnet loses magnetism, spring pulls armature back\n4. Contact is restored, current flows again\n5. This cycle repeats as long as push button is pressed\n\nThe continuous making and breaking of the circuit causes repeated striking.",

      "answer": "Permanent Magnets:\n- Retain magnetic properties without external magnetic field\n- Made of hard materials\n- Cannot be switched on/off\n- Examples: bar magnets, horse-shoe magnets\n\nTemporary Magnets:\n- Behave as magnets only in presence of strong magnetic field\n- Made of soft materials\n- Can be controlled by switching current\n- Examples: electromagnets\n\nKey difference: Permanent magnets keep their magnetism permanently, while temporary magnets lose magnetism when the external field (or current) is removed.",
