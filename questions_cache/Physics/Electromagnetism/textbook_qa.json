Armature movement breaks contact with contact screw, stopping current\n3. Electromagnet loses magnetism, spring pulls armature back\n4. Contact is restored, current flows again\n5.

Damage to internal components: Smartphones contain many components that can be affected by strong magnetic fields, including speakers, microphones, and vibration motors which use small magnets.\n\n2. Compass malfunction: The digital compass in smartphones can be demagnetized or become inaccurate when exposed to strong magnets.\n\n3. Potential data issues: While modern flash storage is generally safe from magnets, strong magnetic fields could potentially interfere with wireless charging components.\n\n4. Electromagnetic interference: High intensity magnets can cause electromagnetic interference with the phone's electronic circuits and sensors.\n\n5. Screen damage: Some older phones with certain display technologies could be affected by strong magnetic fields.\n\nThe principle of electromagnetic induction explains why changing magnetic fields can induce unwanted currents in electronic circuits, potentially disrupting their function.",

      "question": "HOTS: Shaurya made an electromagnet using one battery. Shagun also made an electromagnet using two batteries. Which electromagnet will attract more iron filings? Give reason.",
      "answer": "Shagun's electromagnet (made with two batteries) will attract more iron filings.\n\nReason:\n1. The strength of an electromagnet is directly proportional to the amount of electric current flowing through the coil.\n\n2. Two batteries connected in series will provide more voltage than one battery.\n\n3. More voltage means more current will flow through the coil (assuming same wire and resistance).\n\n4. More current creates a stronger magnetic field around the electromagnet.\n\n5. A stronger magnetic field can attract more iron filings.\n\nThis demonstrates one of the factors that affect electromagnet strength: the amount of current. The other factor is the number of turns of wire in the coil.",

      "question": "Who was Michael Faraday? What were his contributions to science?",
      "answer": "Michael Faraday (1791-1867) was an English scientist known for his pioneering experiments in electricity and magnetism.\n\nMajor contributions:\n\n1. Electromagnetic Induction (1831): Faraday discovered that a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current in a conductor. This principle is the basis for electric generators and transformers.\n\n2. Laws of Electromagnetic Induction: He formulated the laws that explain how and when induced current is produced.\n\n3. Electric Transformer and Generator: His discoveries led to the development of these essential devices that power our modern world.\n\n4. Lines of Magnetic Force: He developed the concept of magnetic lines of force, which became a common idea in modern physics.\n\n5. Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis: He made important discoveries in electrochemistry.\n\nMany consider him the greatest experimentalist of all times. His work laid the foundation for our understanding of electromagnetism and made modern electrical technology possible.",
