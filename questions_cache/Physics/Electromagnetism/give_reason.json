      "statement": "Soft iron is used as the core of an electromagnet instead of steel.",
      "reason": "Soft iron is used because it easily gets magnetized when current flows and quickly loses its magnetism when current stops. Steel, being a hard material, would retain magnetism even after current is switched off, making it unsuitable for a temporary magnet that needs to be controlled.",

      "statement": "An electromagnet is called a temporary magnet.",
      "reason": "An electromagnet is called a temporary magnet because it retains the property of magnetism only when an electric current is passed through it. As soon as the current is stopped, the soft iron core loses its magnetism immediately.",

      "statement": "Insulated copper wire is used in electromagnets instead of bare copper wire.",
      "reason": "Insulated copper wire is used to prevent short circuits between adjacent turns of the coil. If bare wire is used, the turns would touch each other and current would flow directly without going through all the turns, making the electromagnet ineffective.",

      "statement": "The hammer in an electric bell keeps striking the gong repeatedly when the push button is pressed.",
      "reason": "This happens due to the make-and-break mechanism. When current flows, the electromagnet attracts the armature, causing hammer to hit gong and breaking the circuit. When circuit breaks, electromagnet loses magnetism and spring pulls armature back, completing circuit again. This cycle repeats continuously.",

      "statement": "Electromagnets are preferred over permanent magnets in cranes for lifting scrap iron.",
      "reason": "Electromagnets are preferred because their magnetism can be switched on and off. The crane can attract and lift scrap iron when current is on, and release it at the desired location by switching off the current. Permanent magnets cannot release the load easily.",

      "statement": "Increasing the number of turns of the coil increases the strength of an electromagnet.",
      "reason": "When the number of turns increases, more magnetic field is produced per unit length of the electromagnet. Each turn of wire carrying current contributes to the total magnetic field. Hence, the strength of the electromagnet is directly proportional to the number of turns.",

      "reason": "When current increases, the magnetic field produced by each turn of the coil becomes stronger. Since the magnetic field is directly proportional to the current flowing through the conductor, the overall strength of the electromagnet increases with more current.",

      "statement": "We cannot have a magnet with a single pole.",
      "reason": "Every magnet must have two poles - north and south. Even if a magnet appears to have a single pole (like those sold with one pole covered), it still has both poles. One pole may be covered with adhesive or surrounded by a plastic or metal cup, but it exists.",

      "reason": "Iron is used for the armature because it is a magnetic material that can be easily attracted by the electromagnet. When the electromagnet is energized, it attracts the iron armature towards itself, causing the hammer to strike the gong.",

      "statement": "An electric bell stops ringing when the push button is released.",
      "reason": "When the push button is released, the circuit is broken at the switch itself. No current flows to the electromagnet, so it cannot attract the armature. The make-and-break cycle stops and the bell stops ringing.",

      "reason": "For electromagnetic induction to occur, there must be a change in the magnetic lines of force associated with the conductor. A constant magnetic field does not induce any current. Only when the magnetic field changes (increases, decreases, or moves), current is induced in the conductor.",

      "reason": "Without relative motion, there is no change in magnetic flux through the conductor. The magnetic lines of force cutting the conductor must change for current to be induced. Either the magnet or the conductor must move relative to the other.",

      "statement": "Paper clips fall off the electromagnet when the switch is turned off.",
      "reason": "When the switch is turned off, current stops flowing through the coil. Without current, the soft iron core loses its magnetism immediately because it has low retentivity. The paper clips are no longer attracted and fall off.",

      "statement": "U-shaped electromagnets are preferred in electric bells over bar-shaped ones.",
      "reason": "U-shaped electromagnets have both poles on the same side, creating a concentrated magnetic field. This provides stronger attraction for the armature compared to bar-shaped electromagnets where poles are at opposite ends. The stronger attraction makes the bell mechanism work more effectively.",

      "statement": "Generators produce alternating current when a coil is rotated continuously.",
      "reason": "As the coil rotates in the magnetic field, it cuts through magnetic lines of force in alternating directions. When moving one way, current flows in one direction; when moving the opposite way, current reverses. This continuous reversal produces alternating current.",

      "reason": "Electromagnets attract only magnetic materials like iron and steel, while non-magnetic materials like plastic, glass, and aluminum remain unaffected. This allows efficient separation of iron from mixed waste, and the electromagnet can be switched off to release the collected iron.",
