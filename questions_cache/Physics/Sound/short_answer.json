      "question": "Why can't sound travel through vacuum?",
      "answer": "Sound requires a material medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel because it propagates through the vibration of particles. In vacuum, there are no particles to vibrate and transmit the sound waves.",

      "question": "What determines the pitch of a sound? Give an example.",
      "answer": "The pitch of a sound is determined by its frequency. Higher frequency produces higher pitch (shriller sound), and lower frequency produces lower pitch (grave sound). For example, a whistle has high pitch while a drum has low pitch.",

    {
      "id": "sa011",
      "question": "Why does sound travel faster in solids than in gases?",
      "answer": "Sound travels faster in solids because the particles are closely packed and rigidly bound, allowing vibrations to be transmitted quickly. In gases, particles are far apart and loosely connected, so vibrations take longer to transfer.",

      "question": "Why is the voice of a child shriller than that of an adult?",
      "answer": "A child's voice is shriller because children have shorter and thinner vocal cords compared to adults. Shorter vocal cords vibrate faster, producing sound with higher frequency, which we perceive as higher pitch (shriller voice).",

      "id": "sa025",
      "question": "How does temperature affect the speed of sound?",
      "answer": "The speed of sound increases with increase in temperature. This is because at higher temperatures, air molecules move faster and can transmit vibrations more quickly. For every 1°C rise in temperature, the speed of sound in air increases by about 0.6 m/s.",

      "question": "What is persistence of hearing?",
      "answer": "Persistence of hearing is the property of human ear by which the sensation of sound lingers in the ear for about 0.1 seconds after the source has stopped producing sound. This is why we need at least 0.1 seconds gap to hear two sounds separately.",
