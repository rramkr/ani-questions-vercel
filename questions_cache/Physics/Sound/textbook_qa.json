      "answer": "Reflection of sound is the process of bouncing back of sound on striking a surface. When sound waves strike a hard surface, they bounce back just like light gets reflected. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Echo is an example of reflection of sound. Sound is reflected better by hard, smooth surfaces like metals and walls, while soft and porous materials like curtains and sponge absorb sound.",

Place a squeaking toy in a polythene bag and hold it in a bucket of water\n2. Place your ear against the side of the bucket\n3. Squeeze the toy\n\nObservation: You will observe that the sound travels through the water and the surface of the bucket and reaches your ear. The sound can be heard clearly.\n\nConclusion: Sound can travel through liquids. In general, sound travels better through liquids than through gases because liquid particles are closer together than gas particles, allowing vibrations to be transferred more efficiently.",

      "question": "How do the following produce sound?\na. human beings\nb. animals",
      "answer": "a. Sound produced by human beings:\nHumans produce sound with the help of an organ called the larynx or voice box. The larynx lies between the pharynx and the trachea. It has a pair of stretchable ligaments known as vocal cords. A narrow slit is present between the two vocal cords for the passage of air. When air from the lungs is pushed through this gap, the vocal cords vibrate and produce sound. The muscles attached to the vocal cords can stretch or loosen them, changing the frequency of vibrations. When vocal cords are tight and thin, the voice is of high frequency (shrill). When they are loose and thick, the voice is of low frequency.\n\nb. Sound produced by animals:\n- Animals with lungs (like frogs and most mammals) produce sound by blowing air through their vocal cords\n- Unlike humans, most animals cannot make complex sounds because their larynx usually lies at a much higher position in the windpipe\n- Birds have a ring of cartilage called syrinx fixed at the lower part of their windpipes. Sound is produced when air passes through it. Some birds have two parts in their voice box, allowing them to produce two notes at the same time\n- Fish have air bladders which when vibrated produce sound\n- Grasshoppers produce a chirping sound by rubbing the stiff hair on their legs\n- Mosquitoes and bees make a buzzing sound by rapidly vibrating their wings\n- Snakes hiss by forcing air out of their mouths",

      "question": "How is sound produced by different types of musical instruments?",
      "answer": "Musical instruments produce sound through vibrations. They are classified into four groups based on which part vibrates:\n\n1. Stringed instruments:\n- These have a hollow body and strings\n- The stretched strings vibrate when plucked or stroked with a bow\n- The hollow body enhances the sound (acts as a resonator)\n- Air trapped inside forms an air column\n- Examples: Veena, santoor, guitar, harp, tanpura, sitar, violin\n\n2. Percussion or membrane instruments:\n- These have a hollow frame with a skin or membrane stretched tightly across their openings\n- When the skin is struck, vibrations are produced\n- Examples: Drum, tabla, dholak\n\n3. Wind instruments:\n- Sound is produced due to vibration of air columns when air is blown into them\n- Examples: Flute, bugle, trumpet, clarinet\n\n4. Reed instruments:\n- These have metal reeds\n- Sound is produced when air is blown through these metal reeds\n- Examples: Harmonium, trumpet, mouth organ, saxophone\n\nOther instruments:\n- Jal tarang: Frequency adjusted by using appropriate amount of water in musical cups\n- Bells: Produce sound when struck with a soft internal clapper\n- Manjira and ghatam (mud pots): Produce sound when struck",

      "question": "Define the following: oscillation, wavelength, frequency, time period, amplitude",
      "answer": "1. Oscillation: The to and fro motion of particles of the medium when one full wave is constituted is known as one oscillation. A wave starting from point A and reaching point C (one complete cycle) denotes one oscillation.\n\n2. Wavelength: The length of a wave along the x-axis, that is, the distance between two successive crests or troughs, is known as its wavelength. It is represented by the Greek letter lambda (λ). Its SI unit is metre (m). It is also the distance covered by a wave in one complete oscillation.\n\n3. Frequency: The number of oscillations made by a wave in unit time (one second) is called its frequency. Its SI unit is hertz (Hz). For example, a tuning fork with a frequency of 384 Hz makes 384 oscillations per second.\n\n4. Time period: The time taken by a wave to complete one oscillation is called its time period. It is represented by T and its SI unit is second (s). Time period and frequency are reciprocals: T = 1/f or f = 1/T. For example, if frequency is 1000 Hz, time period = 1/1000 = 0.001 s.\n\n5. Amplitude: The maximum displacement of a wave on either side of its mean position is called its amplitude. Its SI unit is metre (m). Amplitude determines the loudness of sound - greater amplitude produces louder sound. Two waves of the same frequency can have different amplitudes.",

      "question": "Explain the factors on which the loudness of sound depends.",
      "answer": "Loudness of sound depends upon the following factors:\n\n1. Amplitude of vibration:\n- Vibrations of large amplitude or intensity produce loud sounds\n- Vibrations of small amplitude produce soft sounds\n- For example, a rubber band plucked softly produces a soft sound, while the same band plucked with greater force produces a louder sound\n- Loudness of sound is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of vibration\n- If the amplitude of vibration is doubled, the loudness of sound increases four times\n\n2. Distance between the listener and the source:\n- As the distance between the listener and the source increases, loudness of sound decreases\n- Sound energy spreads over a larger area as it travels farther from the source\n\n3. Area of the vibrating body:\n- Loudness of sound also depends upon the area of the vibrating body\n- Larger the area, louder is the sound produced\n- A drum of larger size will produce a louder sound than a smaller drum\n\n4. Sensitivity of the ear to the sound:\n- Loudness of sound also depends on the sensitivity of the ears of the listener\n- Different people may perceive the same sound as having different loudness\n\nNote: Loudness does NOT depend upon the frequency of the vibrating particle.",

      "question": "What are ultrasonic sounds? State five uses of such sounds.",
      "answer": "Ultrasonic sounds are sounds of frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz (above the upper limit of human hearing). Some animals such as dogs, leopards, monkeys, and deer can hear ultrasonic sounds but the human ear cannot.\n\nFive uses of ultrasonic sounds:\n\n1. Echolocation by bats: Bats can produce and detect ultrasonic sounds. These waves return to them after getting reflected from objects around them. This helps bats detect prey or obstacles in their path. Whales and seals also use this method.\n\n2. Medical imaging (Ultrasonography): Ultrasonic sounds are used for imaging and scanning internal organs of the body. Reflected waves from different portions of an organ are used to create a picture of the organ. This is used for pregnancy monitoring and examining internal organs.\n\n3. Relieving pain: Ultrasonic sound is used for relieving pain in muscles and joints.\n\n4. Cleaning: Dishwashers use ultrasonics in which water and detergent are vibrated to clean utensils using ultrasonic vibrators. Also used for removal of grease or dirt from materials, and tartar from teeth.\n\n5. Industrial testing: Ultrasonic sounds are used to detect fine faults and cracks in metal sheets for use in aviation, spaceships, and machinery.\n\n6. SONAR: Used by ships and submarines for underwater navigation and detection of objects.\n\n7. Galton's whistle: Can produce frequencies greater than 20,000 Hz, used to train dogs.\n\n8. Making milk powder: Ultrasonic vibrators mix milk with adequate amount of fat to produce milk powder.",

      "answer": "a. a material that can absorb more sound waves than it reflects\n\nExplanation: Cinema halls require materials that absorb sound rather than reflect it. This is because:\n1. Excessive reflection causes reverberation (prolonged sound due to multiple reflections)\n2. Reverberation interferes with the clarity of the new sounds being produced\n3. Sound absorbing materials on walls, ceiling, and floors help regulate the acoustics\n4. Materials like thick carpets, curtains, and rough/porous materials absorb sound effectively\n5.

      "answer": "a. Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.\n\nExplanation:\n- The assertion is true: When strings are plucked with greater force, louder sound is produced.\n- The reason is also true: Greater force causes larger amplitude of vibration.\n- The reason correctly explains the assertion because loudness of sound is directly proportional to the square of amplitude. When amplitude increases (due to greater force), loudness increases.\n- Therefore, both statements are true and R correctly explains A.",
