      "answer": "(i) The loudness is greater in the upper wave (marked 'Louder'). This is because the upper wave has a larger amplitude. Loudness is proportional to the square of amplitude, so larger amplitude produces louder sound.\n\n(ii) The factor is **Amplitude** - the maximum displacement of vibrating particles from their mean position.\n\n(iii) Two other factors affecting loudness:\n1. Distance from the source - sound becomes softer as distance increases due to spreading and absorption\n2. Power/energy of the source - more powerful vibrations produce louder sound\n3. Surface area of the vibrating body - larger vibrating surfaces produce louder sound"
