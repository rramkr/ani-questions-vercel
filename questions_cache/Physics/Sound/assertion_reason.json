      "assertion": "Sound cannot travel through vacuum.",
      "reason": "Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a material medium for propagation.",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "options": [
        "A. Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",

        "C. Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
        "D. Assertion is false but Reason is true."
      ],
      "explanation": "Sound waves are mechanical waves that travel through the vibration of particles. In vacuum, there are no particles to vibrate, so sound cannot propagate.",

    },
    {
      "id": "ar002",
      "assertion": "Sound travels faster in steel than in air.",
      "reason": "Particles in solids are closely packed.",

        "D. Assertion is false but Reason is true."
      ],
      "explanation": "In solids like steel, particles are closely packed with strong intermolecular forces, allowing vibrations to transfer quickly. This is why sound travels faster in steel (~5000 m/s) than in air (~340 m/s).",

      "id": "ar009",
      "assertion": "Sound waves are longitudinal waves.",
