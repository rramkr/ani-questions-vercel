      "answer": "This depends on how the circuit is wired:\n\n- If bulbs and switches are in series: Neither B₁ nor B₂ will glow because an open switch (A₁) breaks the entire series circuit.\n\n- If each bulb has its own switch in parallel branches:\n  - If A₁ controls B₁: B₁ will NOT glow (switch open)\n  - If A₂ controls B₂: B₂ WILL glow (switch closed)\n\nIn a typical parallel circuit where each switch controls its corresponding bulb, only B₂ would glow because only A₂ is closed, providing a complete path for current to flow through B₂.",

      "answer": "The magnitude of induced current can be increased by:\n\n1. Increasing the number of turns in the coil: More turns mean more cutting of magnetic lines of force, producing more induced EMF and current.\n\n2. Increasing the strength of the magnet: A stronger magnet has more magnetic lines of force, so moving it causes a greater change in magnetic flux.\n\n3. Increasing the relative speed between the magnet and coil: Faster movement means a faster rate of change of magnetic flux, which produces greater induced current.\n\n4. Using a stronger core material: Using soft iron core inside the coil concentrates the magnetic field.",
