      "question": "Describe the construction and working of a dry cell.",
      "answer": "Construction of a dry cell: A dry cell consists of the following parts:\n\n1. Zinc container: Acts as the negative electrode (cathode). The metal case at the bottom acts as the negative terminal.\n\n2. Carbon rod: Placed at the centre with a brass cap. This acts as the positive electrode (anode). The brass cap at the top acts as the positive terminal.\n\n3. Mixture of manganese dioxide (MnO2) and carbon (C): Surrounds the carbon rod in a muslin bag.\n\n4. Electrolyte: A moist paste of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and plaster of Paris.\n\n5. Outer insulation: The outer body (except the metal base) of the zinc container is insulated with thick cardboard or plastic.\n\nWorking: When both the electrodes of a dry cell are connected in a torch, it causes a chemical reaction between the electrolyte and the electrodes. As a result, a potential difference is produced in the cell causing a current to flow through the bulb and the bulb glows. Once the chemicals are used up, the cell can no longer be used and has to be discarded.\n\nAdvantages: The dry cell is very small, light and portable. There is no fear of leakage in dry cells. It is used in television remotes, torches, calculators and toys.",

      "question": "State the precautions to be taken while using electricity.",
      "answer": "Precautions while using electricity:\n\n1. Do not touch electrical appliances and switches with wet hands, as tap water and your body, being good conductors of electricity, will cause the current to flow through the body.\n\n2. Never get electrical repairs done by an untrained person.\n\n3. Check that the plug fits properly in the socket; otherwise there will be sparking and burning of the socket.\n\n4. Never touch the metallic parts of electrical appliances with bare hands or with any metal object, especially when they are in use.\n\n5. Use only ISI marked wires. Cover all naked wires with insulating tape. Do not touch live wires with bare hands.\n\n6. Stand on an insulator such as a rubber mat or a wooden board when doing electrical work.\n\n7. Put off the main switch immediately in case of short circuit and fire.\n\nAdditional safety information from the text:\n- The ISI mark indicates that an electrical appliance is safe to use. One must look for the ISI mark before buying an electrical appliance.\n- 90% of outside power lines are bare wires and uninsulated. So no power line is completely safe to touch or approach too closely.",

      "question": "Explain electric current and potential difference. What is the relationship between them?",
      "answer": "Electric Current:\n\nElectric current is the flow of electric charges from a region of excess electrons to a region with deficit of electrons. It is caused by the movement of free electrons in a particular direction.\n\n- SI unit: Ampere (A)\n- Formula: I = Q/t (Current = Charge/Time)\n- Where I is current in ampere, Q is charge in coulomb, and t is time in seconds.\n\nDirection of Current:\n- Conventional current flows from positive terminal to negative terminal.\n- Actual electron flow is opposite - from negative to positive terminal.\n- This convention was established before electrons were discovered.\n\nPotential Difference:\n\nPotential difference is the amount of work done in moving a unit charge from one point to another. It is required for electric current to flow.\n\n- SI unit: Volt (V)\n- Named after Italian physicist Alessandro Volta.\n- 1 Volt = 1 Joule of work done to move 1 Coulomb of charge.\n\nRelationship:\n\nElectric current flows only when there is a potential difference. The current flows from a high potential region (excess electrons) to a low potential region (deficit of electrons). Without potential difference, there is no driving force for the electrons to move, so no current flows.",

      "question": "What are conductors and insulators? Give examples and explain their importance in electrical applications.",
      "answer": "Conductors:\n\nConductors are substances which allow electric current to flow through them easily. This is because they have free electrons that can move within the material.\n\nExamples of conductors:\n- All metals: copper, silver, nickel, aluminium, iron and steel\n- Tap water (impure water)\n- Human body\n\nNote: Pure water (distilled water) is an insulator because it has very few ions.\n\nInsulators:\n\nInsulators are substances which do not allow electric current to flow through them. They do not have free electrons.\n\nExamples of insulators:\n- Cotton, rubber, paper\n- Glass, ceramics, plastic\n- Wood, pure water\n- Air\n\nImportance in Electrical Applications:\n\n1. Safety: Electric wires are always covered with insulators such as plastic to make them safe. This prevents electric shocks.\n\n2. Circuit design: Conductors (like copper) are used to make wires that carry current. Insulators (like plastic) are used to cover the wires and prevent current leakage.\n\n3. Switch construction: Switches use both conductors (for current flow when closed) and insulators (to prevent current when open).\n\n4. Worker safety: Electricians stand on rubber mats (insulator) when doing electrical work to protect from shocks.\n\n5. Plug and socket design: The metal parts are conductors, while the outer body is made of insulating material.",

      "question": "Compare and contrast fuse and MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker). Which is preferred in modern homes and why?",
      "answer": "Fuse:\n\nA fuse is a safety device that protects electrical circuits from overcurrent. It contains a thin wire made of metal with low melting point.\n\nHow it works:\n- The fuse wire melts when current exceeds the permissible value.\n- This breaks the circuit and stops current flow.\n- Protects appliances from damage due to overcurrent.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Once blown, needs to be replaced with a new fuse.\n- Less sensitive to small voltage fluctuations.\n- Cheaper initial cost.\n- Manual replacement needed after tripping.\n\nMCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker):\n\nMCB stands for Miniature Circuit Breaker. It is an automatically operated electrical switch.\n\nHow it works:\n- Automatically switches off when there is excessive current flow.\n- Can also detect slight voltage fluctuations.\n- Uses electromagnetic mechanism to trip.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Can be reset after tripping (reusable).\n- More sensitive to current changes.\n- Higher initial cost but saves money long-term.\n- No replacement needed.\n\nWhy MCB is Preferred in Modern Homes:\n\n1. Reusability: MCB can be reset and reused after tripping, while fuse needs replacement every time.\n\n2. Better sensitivity: MCB can detect even slight voltage fluctuations and respond faster.\n\n3. Convenience: After a trip, MCB just needs to be switched back on, making it more convenient.\n\n4. Long-term economy: Although MCB has higher initial cost, it saves money by not requiring replacements.\n\n5. Safety: MCB provides better protection due to its higher sensitivity.",

      "question": "Explain the structure of an atom and describe how electric current is produced due to the flow of electrons.",
      "answer": "Structure of an Atom:\n\nAtoms are the smallest particles of matter. Every atom consists of three types of subatomic particles:\n\n1. Protons:\n- Located in the nucleus (centre of the atom)\n- Carry positive charge\n- Help determine the identity of the element\n\n2. Neutrons:\n- Located in the nucleus\n- Carry no charge (neutral)\n- Add mass to the atom\n\n3. Electrons:\n- Revolve around the nucleus in paths called orbits\n- Carry negative charge\n- Mass is negligible compared to protons and neutrons\n- Responsible for electric current\n\nProduction of Electric Current:\n\nElectric current is the flow of electric charges, specifically the movement of free electrons.\n\n1. Free Electrons: In conductors (like metals), some electrons are loosely bound to their atoms and can move freely. These are called free electrons.\n\n2. Potential Difference: When a potential difference is applied (using a cell or battery), it creates an electric field.\n\n3. Electron Flow: The free electrons experience a force due to the electric field. They move from the region of excess electrons (negative terminal) to the region with deficit of electrons (positive terminal).\n\n4. Current Flow: This continuous movement of electrons constitutes electric current. By convention, the direction of current is taken as opposite to the electron flow (from positive to negative terminal).\n\nMathematical Relationship:\n- Current (I) = Charge (Q) / Time (t)\n- I = Q/t\n- Where I is in Ampere, Q in Coulomb, t in seconds\n\nThe SI unit of charge is Coulomb (C) and the SI unit of current is Ampere (A).",
