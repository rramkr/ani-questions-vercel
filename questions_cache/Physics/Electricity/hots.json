      "question": "Three bulbs X, Y and Z are connected to a cell in series. If the filament of Y is broken, which bulb(s) will glow?",
      "context": "Understanding series circuit behavior when one component fails.",
      "answer": "None of the bulbs will glow. In a series circuit, all appliances depend upon each other to complete the circuit. When bulb Y's filament breaks, the circuit becomes incomplete (open), and no current can flow through any of the bulbs. This is why series connections are not used for household wiring.",

      "context": "Testing understanding of conductors and insulators.",
      "answer": "No, the bulb will not glow. Distilled water (pure water) is an insulator and does not conduct electricity. Only impure water, which contains dissolved salts and ions, can conduct electricity. Since no current can flow through the distilled water, the circuit remains incomplete and the bulb does not glow.",

      "question": "Why are the appliances in a household not connected in series?",
      "context": "Practical application of circuit knowledge.",
      "answer": "Household appliances are not connected in series because: (1) In series, there is sharing of voltage, so each appliance may not get sufficient power. (2) If one appliance stops working or is switched off, all other appliances also stop working. (3) All appliances would have to be on at the same time. Instead, parallel connection is used so each appliance gets the original voltage and works independently.",

      "answer": "Possible reasons why the bulb does not glow: (1) The circuit may be open at some point - a wire may not be properly connected. (2) The cell/battery may be exhausted (chemicals used up). (3) The bulb may be fused (filament broken). (4) The switch may be in the off position. (5) A loose connection at any point creates an open circuit, and since air is an insulator, no current flows.",

      "context": "Application of safety knowledge.",
      "answer": "An electrician stands on a wooden stool because wood is an insulator. If the electrician accidentally touches a live wire, the current cannot pass through the wooden stool to reach the ground, thus preventing electric shock.

      "context": "Understanding cell operation and failure.",
      "answer": "When a cell is connected in a circuit, a chemical reaction takes place inside between the electrolyte and electrodes, creating a potential difference that causes current to flow. When the cell is exhausted, the chemicals inside are used up. Without the chemical reaction, no potential difference is produced. Since current flows only when there is a potential difference, no current flows and the bulb does not glow. The cell has to be discarded.",

      "context": "Understanding independent operation in parallel circuits.",
      "answer": "Only bulb X will glow. In a parallel circuit, each appliance can be operated independently with its own switch. When switch X is closed, current flows through bulb X and it glows. When switch Y is open, that branch of the circuit is incomplete, so no current flows through bulb Y and it does not glow. This is exactly why household appliances are connected in parallel.",

      "question": "Why is it dangerous to touch outside power lines even if they appear to have coating on them?",
      "context": "Application of Myth vs Fact knowledge.",
      "answer": "It is dangerous because 90% of outside power lines are bare wires and uninsulated. Even if they appear to have coating, it is usually just weather coating that provides no insulation or protection from electric shock. Even truly insulated lines could be unprotected after being exposed to years of weather. So no power line is completely safe to touch or approach too closely, ever.",

      "context": "Understanding battery formation and capacity.",
      "answer": "Vehicles use batteries because a single cell gives only a small amount of electricity. Vehicles need more electrical energy to operate their systems. A battery is formed by connecting multiple cells in series, where the positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next. This increases the amount of electrical energy available, providing sufficient power for the vehicle.",

      "context": "Understanding primary vs secondary cells.",
      "answer": "A rechargeable cell (secondary cell) costs more because it contains special materials that allow the chemical reaction inside to be reversible. This allows it to be recharged and reused many times. A non-rechargeable cell (primary cell) has an irreversible chemical reaction, so once the chemicals are used up, it must be discarded. Though the initial cost is higher, a rechargeable cell is more economical in the long run.",

      "answer": "Solar cells convert light energy (not just sunlight) into electrical energy. They can work with any source of light, including artificial light from bulbs or tube lights. The intensity of light affects how much electricity is generated - brighter light produces more electricity. For a calculator, which needs very little power, even indoor artificial light provides sufficient energy for the solar cells to operate it.",

      "context": "Comparing safety features of MCB and fuse.",
      "answer": "MCB is safer because: (1) MCB is more sensitive to current than a fuse - it can detect even a slight fluctuation in voltage and interrupt the circuit current fast, providing quicker protection. (2) MCB can be easily reset after tripping, while a fuse needs to be replaced. This means in an emergency, MCB can be restored quickly, and there's no risk of using wrong-rated fuse wire during replacement.",

      "context": "Understanding energy conversion in circuits.",
      "answer": "Even though the same current flows through all components in a series circuit, bulbs can glow with different brightness due to different resistance values. A bulb with higher resistance converts more electrical energy into light and heat energy, making it glow brighter. Also, different bulbs are designed for different wattages - a 100W bulb will glow brighter than a 40W bulb even with the same current.",

      "question": "Why are overhead electrical transmission lines not insulated while household wires are always insulated?",
      "context": "Understanding practical electrical engineering decisions.",
      "answer": "Overhead transmission lines are not insulated because: (1) The cost of insulating thousands of kilometers of high-voltage lines would be enormous. (2) Air itself acts as an insulator - the lines are placed high enough that accidental contact is unlikely. (3) The weight of insulation would require stronger, more expensive support towers. Household wires are insulated because they are within reach and frequently touched, making safety essential. This is also why 90% of power lines are bare wires.",

      "context": "Understanding cell chemistry and shelf life.",
      "answer": "A dry cell can stop working even without use because: (1) Slow chemical reactions continue inside the cell even when not in use, gradually consuming the chemicals. (2) The electrolyte (moist paste of ammonium chloride and plaster of Paris) can dry out over time, reducing the cell's ability to conduct ions. (3) Internal corrosion of the zinc container can occur. This is why cells have an expiry date, and old unused cells may not work.",

      "answer": "In a hydroelectric power station, the energy comes from flowing water. Water stored in a dam at height has potential energy. When this water is released and flows downward through pipes to the turbines, the potential energy converts to kinetic energy. This kinetic energy rotates the turbines, which are connected to generators. The generators convert this mechanical energy into electrical energy. The ultimate source is the water cycle powered by solar energy.",

      "context": "Understanding electrical concepts and safety.",
      "answer": "Birds can sit on power lines without getting electrocuted because: (1) They touch only one wire, so there is no potential difference across their body. (2) For current to flow, there must be a complete circuit - the bird would need to touch two wires at different potentials or touch a wire and the ground simultaneously. (3) The bird's body has higher resistance than the wire, so even if there was a path, minimal current would flow through them. However, if a bird touches two wires or a wire and a grounded pole, it would be electrocuted.",

      "context": "Understanding wire selection based on current capacity.",
      "answer": "The thickness of wire depends on the current it needs to carry. Main power lines carry current for all appliances in a home, so they need thick wires to handle high current without overheating. Thin wires would have high resistance, causing them to heat up and potentially melt. Small appliances draw less current, so thin wires are sufficient. Copper is used because it's an excellent conductor. Using unnecessarily thick wires would be wasteful and expensive.",

(2) When you want all devices to start/stop together for safety. (3) Decorative lights are sometimes in series for simplicity. However, household appliances need parallel because: (1) Each appliance needs original voltage to work properly. (2) Each must work independently. (3) One faulty appliance shouldn't stop all others.
