    {"id": "sa001", "question": "Define energy.", "answer": "Energy is the capacity or ability to do work. It exists in various forms and can be converted from one form to another.", "key_points": ["Capacity to do work", "Exists in various forms", "Can be converted"], "keywords": ["energy", "work", "capacity"], "source_section": "Introduction"},
    {"id": "sa002", "question": "What is kinetic energy? Write its formula.", "answer": "Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its motion. Formula: KE = ½mv², where m is mass and v is velocity.", "key_points": ["Energy of motion", "KE = ½mv²"], "keywords": ["kinetic", "motion", "velocity"], "source_section": "Kinetic Energy"},
    {"id": "sa003", "question": "What is potential energy? Give two types.", "answer": "Potential energy is the energy stored in a body due to its position or configuration. Types: (1) Gravitational PE (due to height), (2) Elastic PE (due to deformation like in springs).", "key_points": ["Stored energy", "Position/configuration", "Gravitational and elastic"], "keywords": ["potential", "stored", "position"], "source_section": "Potential Energy"},
    {"id": "sa004", "question": "State the law of conservation of energy.", "answer": "Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only be transformed from one form to another. The total energy of an isolated system remains constant.", "key_points": ["Cannot be created/destroyed", "Only transformed", "Total remains constant"], "keywords": ["conservation", "transform", "constant"], "source_section": "Conservation"},
    {"id": "sa005", "question": "Define power and write its SI unit.", "answer": "Power is the rate of doing work or the rate of energy transfer. Power = Work/Time. SI unit is Watt (W), where 1 W = 1 J/s.", "key_points": ["Rate of work", "P = W/t", "Unit is Watt"], "keywords": ["power", "rate", "watt"], "source_section": "Power"},
    {"id": "sa006", "question": "What is mechanical energy?", "answer": "Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of a body. ME = KE + PE. In the absence of friction, mechanical energy is conserved.", "key_points": ["ME = KE + PE", "Conserved without friction"], "keywords": ["mechanical", "kinetic", "potential"], "source_section": "Mechanical Energy"},
    {"id": "sa007", "question": "Differentiate between renewable and non-renewable energy sources.", "answer": "Renewable sources are continuously replenished naturally (solar, wind, hydro) and won't run out. Non-renewable sources have limited reserves and take millions of years to form (coal, petroleum, natural gas).", "key_points": ["Renewable: replenished naturally", "Non-renewable: limited reserves"], "keywords": ["renewable", "non-renewable", "replenish"], "source_section": "Sources"},
    {"id": "sa008", "question": "Why does kinetic energy depend on the square of velocity?", "answer": "From work-energy theorem, KE = ½mv². The v² dependence comes from the physics of acceleration: stopping distance is proportional to v², and work = force × distance. Doubling velocity quadruples the energy.", "key_points": ["KE ∝ v²", "Doubling v gives 4× KE"], "keywords": ["velocity squared", "doubling"], "source_section": "Kinetic Energy"},
    {"id": "sa009", "question": "What is 1 kilowatt-hour? Express it in joules.", "answer": "1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is the energy consumed when a device of power 1 kW operates for 1 hour. 1 kWh = 1000 W × 3600 s = 3,600,000 J = 3.6 MJ. It's the commercial unit of electrical energy.", "key_points": ["1 kW for 1 hour", "= 3.6 × 10⁶ J", "Commercial unit"], "keywords": ["kWh", "unit", "joules"], "source_section": "Units"},
    {"id": "sa010", "question": "Explain energy transformation in a hydroelectric power plant.", "answer": "Water stored at height has gravitational PE → Water falls, PE converts to KE → Moving water rotates turbines (mechanical energy) → Turbines drive generators → Mechanical energy converts to electrical energy.", "key_points": ["PE → KE → Mechanical → Electrical"], "keywords": ["hydroelectric", "transformation", "turbine"], "source_section": "Transformation"}
