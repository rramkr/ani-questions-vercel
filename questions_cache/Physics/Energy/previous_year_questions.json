      "correct_answer": "d) The heavier particles move up and the lighter particles sink down while a convection current is set up",
      "explanation": "This statement is INCORRECT. In convection, LIGHTER (heated) particles rise up and HEAVIER (cooler) particles sink down. When fluid is heated, it becomes less dense and rises; cooler, denser fluid sinks to take its place."

      "correct_answer": "c) When placed in beaker Y, the metal ball loses heat and water gains heat",
      "explanation": "Heat always flows from a hotter body to a cooler body. The hot metal ball (at 100°C) will lose heat to the cooler water (at 25°C) until they reach thermal equilibrium. The water gains the heat lost by the ball."

Give reason.\n(c) Why do the pins fall? Explain in terms of molecular theory.",
      "answer": "(a) The process is **CONDUCTION**.\nDefinition: Conduction is the process of heat transfer through a solid (or substance) by the vibration of particles from molecule to molecule, without the particles actually moving from their positions.\n\n(b) Both pins are likely to fall simultaneously in **Case A (the metal loop)**.\nReason: In the loop, when heat is applied at one point, it travels in both directions around the loop simultaneously. Both pins P and Q are equidistant from the heat source (via the two paths), so they receive heat at the same time and the wax melts together.\n\n(c) Molecular explanation:\nWhen heat is applied, the molecules at that point start vibrating with greater energy. These vibrations are passed on to neighbouring molecules, which in turn pass them to their neighbours. As the heat energy travels along the metal, it eventually reaches the wax. The increased molecular vibration transfers energy to the wax molecules, causing the wax to melt. Once the wax melts, the pins lose their support and fall.",

      "answer": "| Part of the thermos flask | Reduces heat loss by |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Cork stopper | Conduction and Convection - blocks heat escaping through the mouth; cork is a poor conductor |\n| Trapped air | Conduction - air is a poor conductor of heat; reduces heat transfer between layers |\n| Vacuum between walls | Conduction and Convection - vacuum has no particles, so heat cannot transfer by these modes |\n| Brightly polished inner walls | Radiation - shiny surfaces have low emissivity; they reflect heat radiation back rather than absorbing or emitting it |\n\n**Additional explanation:**\nThe thermos flask is designed to minimise all three modes of heat transfer:\n- The stopper and air pockets reduce conduction and convection\n- The vacuum eliminates conduction and convection between the walls\n- The polished surfaces reduce radiation\n\nThis keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for extended periods.",
