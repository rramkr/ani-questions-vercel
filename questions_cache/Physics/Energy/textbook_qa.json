      "answer": "The kinetic energy of a moving body depends on: 1) Mass of the object - Greater the mass of an object, greater is its kinetic energy. A cricket ball moving at the same speed as a tennis ball has more kinetic energy because it has more mass. 2) Speed of the object - Faster the speed of a moving object, greater is its kinetic energy. A fast-moving tennis ball has more kinetic energy than a slow-moving tennis ball.",

      "question": "How do we hear sound?",
      "answer": "Sound is produced by vibrating bodies. When an object vibrates, it causes the air particles around it to vibrate. These vibrations travel through the air as sound waves. When these sound waves reach our ears, they make the membrane inside the ear (eardrum) vibrate. These vibrations are then converted into signals that are sent to the brain, and we perceive sound. Sound energy is also capable of doing work as vibrations caused by sound are a type of motion.",

      "answer": "(a) From A to B: Electrical energy from the motor is converted to mechanical energy (kinetic and potential energy) of the roller coaster. As the coaster rises from A to B, it gains potential energy. (b) From C to D: Potential energy at C is converted to kinetic energy as the coaster goes down, then back to potential energy as it rises through the loop. The total mechanical energy remains constant (law of conservation of energy), allowing the coaster to complete the loop without a motor.",

      "answer": "When a body is held at a height, it has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. As it falls freely, it loses height (potential energy decreases) but gains speed (kinetic energy increases). At any point during the fall, the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy remains constant. Just before hitting the ground, the body has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential energy. Throughout the fall, total mechanical energy (PE + KE) remains constant, demonstrating the law of conservation of energy.",
