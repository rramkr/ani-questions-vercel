      "options": ["a) Bigger than the size of an object", "b) Smaller than the size of an object", "c) Same as the size of an object", "d) Wider than the size of an object"],
      "correct_answer": "c) Same as the size of an object",
      "explanation": "A plane mirror forms a virtual, upright, and same-sized image. The image is laterally inverted and appears as far behind the mirror as the object is in front."

      "correct_answer": "b) Dispersed",

      "diagram_description": "Two diagrams showing types of reflection: (X) shows parallel light rays hitting a smooth surface and reflecting as parallel rays (specular/regular reflection), (Y) shows parallel rays hitting a rough surface and scattering in different directions (diffused reflection).",
      "question": "The diagrams show two kinds of reflection. Surface X shows regular (specular) reflection and Surface Y shows diffused reflection. Which of the following about surfaces X and Y is correct?",
      "options": ["A) X: Plane mirror, Y: Glass block", "B) X: Plane mirror, Y: Rough paper", "C) X: Glass block, Y: Plane mirror", "D) X: Rough paper, Y: Glass block"],
      "correct_answer": "B) X: Plane mirror, Y: Rough paper",
      "explanation": "A smooth, polished surface like a plane mirror gives regular (specular) reflection where parallel rays remain parallel after reflection. A rough surface like paper causes diffused reflection where rays scatter in different directions."

      "question": "An opaque smooth object reflects most of the light that falls on it.",
      "answer": "True",
      "explanation": "An opaque object does not allow light to pass through it. If it is smooth (polished), it reflects most of the incident light, giving a strong specular reflection."

      "question": "A red rose in green light looks yellow.",
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "A red rose can only reflect red light. In green light, there is no red light for the rose to reflect. Therefore, the rose would appear dark/black, not yellow."

      "question": "The bouncing back of light into the same medium after striking a surface is called _____.",

      "answer": "optically denser (or denser/transparent)",
      "explanation": "Light travels slower in optically denser media. In vacuum, light travels at 3×10⁸ m/s, but in glass or water, it slows down because of interaction with the material."
