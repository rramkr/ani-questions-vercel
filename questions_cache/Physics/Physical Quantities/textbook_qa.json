      "answer": "To find the area of a rose petal: 1) Place the rose petal on a graph paper and draw its outline with a pencil. 2) Count the number of complete squares within the outline. 3) Count the number of almost complete squares (more than half filled). 4) Add both numbers. This gives the approximate area of the rose petal in square centimetres (cm²). Note: This method gives only an approximate area, not the exact surface area.",

      "question": "How would you measure the volume of an irregular solid which is insoluble in water, using a measuring cylinder?",
      "answer": "To measure the volume of an irregular solid using a measuring cylinder: 1) Pour a suitable quantity of water in the measuring cylinder (enough to completely immerse the solid). 2) Note the reading of the water level, say R₁. 3) Tie the irregular solid to a thread and immerse it completely into the water. 4) Note the new reading of the water level, say R₂. 5) The volume of the solid = R₂ - R₁. Since 1 mL = 1 cm³, the volume in mL equals the volume in cm³. For solids that dissolve in water, use kerosene instead of water.",

      "answer": "(a) i and iii. Since box A and B have the same mass but B has more balls (larger volume), density of A > density of B. Box C has the most balls (largest volume), so it has the lowest density. Therefore density of Box C < density of Box A.",
