    {"id": "tbq001", "question": "What is a physical quantity?", "answer": "A physical quantity is any quantity that can be measured. It is expressed as a number with a unit. Examples include length, mass, time, temperature, speed, etc. A physical quantity has both numerical value and unit.", "source_section": "Introduction"},
    {"id": "tbq002", "question": "What are fundamental quantities? List the seven SI fundamental quantities with their units.", "answer": "Fundamental quantities are independent physical quantities that cannot be expressed in terms of other quantities. The seven SI fundamental quantities are: (1) Length - metre (m), (2) Mass - kilogram (kg), (3) Time - second (s), (4) Electric current - ampere (A), (5) Temperature - kelvin (K), (6) Amount of substance - mole (mol), (7) Luminous intensity - candela (cd).", "source_section": "Fundamental Quantities"},
    {"id": "tbq003", "question": "What are derived quantities? Give five examples with their SI units.", "answer": "Derived quantities are obtained by combining fundamental quantities through mathematical operations. Examples: (1) Area - square metre (m²), (2) Volume - cubic metre (m³), (3) Speed - metre per second (m/s), (4) Density - kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m³), (5) Force - newton (N).", "source_section": "Derived Quantities"},
    {"id": "tbq004", "question": "What is the SI system of units?", "answer": "SI (Système International d'Unités) is the modern metric system adopted internationally for scientific measurements. It was established in 1960 and provides a coherent set of units for all physical measurements based on seven fundamental units.", "source_section": "SI System"},
    {"id": "tbq005", "question": "Explain the principle of vernier callipers.", "answer": "Vernier callipers work on the principle that a small difference between the main scale and vernier scale divisions allows measurement of smaller lengths. If n vernier divisions equal (n-1) main scale divisions, the least count = 1 MSD - 1 VSD. For standard callipers with 10 VSD = 9 mm, least count = 1 mm - 0.9 mm = 0.1 mm.", "source_section": "Vernier Callipers"},
    {"id": "tbq006", "question": "What is the principle of screw gauge?", "answer": "Screw gauge works on the principle of a screw. When the screw rotates through one complete turn, it moves forward or backward by a distance equal to its pitch. By dividing this motion into smaller parts using the circular scale, very small lengths can be measured. Least count = Pitch/Number of divisions = 1mm/100 = 0.01 mm.", "source_section": "Screw Gauge"},
    {"id": "tbq007", "question": "What is zero error? How is it corrected?", "answer": "Zero error occurs when a measuring instrument shows a non-zero reading when it should read zero. Positive zero error means the instrument reads more than the actual value (subtract the error). Negative zero error means it reads less (add the error). Corrected reading = Observed reading ± Zero error.", "source_section": "Errors"},
    {"id": "tbq008", "question": "What is dimensional formula? Give examples.", "answer": "Dimensional formula expresses a physical quantity in terms of fundamental quantities (M, L, T, etc.). Examples: Velocity = [L T^-1], Force = [M L T^-2], Energy = [M L^2 T^-2], Pressure = [M L^-1 T^-2]. Dimensional formula helps check equations and convert units.", "source_section": "Dimensional Analysis"},
    {"id": "tbq009", "question": "What are the uses of vernier callipers?", "answer": "Vernier callipers are used to measure: (1) External dimensions of objects using external jaws, (2) Internal dimensions like inner diameter of tubes using internal jaws, (3) Depth of containers or holes using the depth rod. It can measure with an accuracy of 0.1 mm.", "source_section": "Vernier Callipers"},
    {"id": "tbq010", "question": "What are the advantages of SI system?", "answer": "Advantages of SI system: (1) It is internationally accepted, (2) It is a coherent system (derived units are obtained from base units), (3) It uses decimal system making conversions easy, (4) It has unique symbols for each unit, (5) It covers all branches of science.", "source_section": "SI System"}
