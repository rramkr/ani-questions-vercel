    {"id": "sa001", "question": "What is a physical quantity?", "answer": "A physical quantity is any quantity that can be measured and expressed in numbers with appropriate units. Examples include length, mass, time, temperature, etc.", "key_points": ["Can be measured", "Expressed in numbers", "Has units"], "keywords": ["physical quantity", "measured", "units"], "source_section": "Introduction"},
    {"id": "sa002", "question": "Define fundamental quantities.", "answer": "Fundamental quantities are basic physical quantities that are independent of each other and cannot be expressed in terms of other quantities. The seven SI fundamental quantities are: length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity.", "key_points": ["Independent", "Cannot be derived", "Seven in SI system"], "keywords": ["fundamental", "independent", "basic"], "source_section": "Fundamental Quantities"},
    {"id": "sa003", "question": "What are derived quantities? Give examples.", "answer": "Derived quantities are physical quantities that are obtained by combining fundamental quantities through multiplication or division. Examples: Area (length × length), Speed (length/time), Force (mass × acceleration), Density (mass/volume).", "key_points": ["Obtained from fundamental quantities", "By multiplication or division"], "keywords": ["derived", "combination", "fundamental"], "source_section": "Derived Quantities"},
    {"id": "sa004", "question": "What is the SI system?", "answer": "SI (Système International d'Unités) is the International System of Units, adopted worldwide for scientific measurements. It has seven fundamental units: metre (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (current), kelvin (temperature), mole (amount of substance), and candela (luminous intensity).", "key_points": ["International standard", "Seven fundamental units", "Used worldwide"], "keywords": ["SI", "international", "system of units"], "source_section": "SI System"},
    {"id": "sa005", "question": "Define least count of a measuring instrument.", "answer": "The least count of a measuring instrument is the smallest measurement that can be accurately taken using that instrument. It represents the precision of the instrument. For example, the least count of a standard vernier callipers is 0.1 mm and that of a screw gauge is 0.01 mm.", "key_points": ["Smallest measurement possible", "Indicates precision", "Different for different instruments"], "keywords": ["least count", "smallest", "precision"], "source_section": "Measuring Instruments"},
    {"id": "sa006", "question": "What is zero error?", "answer": "Zero error is the error in a measuring instrument when it shows a non-zero reading even when nothing is being measured. It is a systematic error. Zero error can be positive (reading more than actual) or negative (reading less than actual). It must be corrected from all measurements.", "key_points": ["Non-zero reading at zero", "Systematic error", "Can be positive or negative"], "keywords": ["zero error", "systematic", "correction"], "source_section": "Errors"},
    {"id": "sa007", "question": "Differentiate between scalar and vector quantities.", "answer": "Scalar quantities have only magnitude (size), e.g., mass, speed, energy, time. Vector quantities have both magnitude and direction, e.g., displacement, velocity, force, acceleration. Scalars follow ordinary algebra; vectors follow vector algebra.", "key_points": ["Scalar: magnitude only", "Vector: magnitude + direction", "Different algebra rules"], "keywords": ["scalar", "vector", "magnitude", "direction"], "source_section": "Scalar and Vector"},
    {"id": "sa008", "question": "What is dimensional analysis?", "answer": "Dimensional analysis is a technique that uses the dimensions of physical quantities to check the correctness of equations, derive relationships between quantities, and convert units. It is based on the principle that only quantities with the same dimensions can be added, subtracted, or equated.", "key_points": ["Uses dimensions", "Check equations", "Derive relationships"], "keywords": ["dimensional analysis", "dimensions", "check correctness"], "source_section": "Dimensional Analysis"},
    {"id": "sa009", "question": "Describe the construction of a vernier callipers.", "answer": "A vernier callipers consists of: (1) Main scale - graduated in cm and mm, (2) Vernier scale - 10 divisions sliding along main scale, (3) External jaws - to measure external dimensions, (4) Internal jaws - to measure internal dimensions, (5) Depth rod - to measure depths, (6) Locking screw - to fix the reading.", "key_points": ["Main scale and vernier scale", "External and internal jaws", "Depth measuring rod"], "keywords": ["vernier callipers", "main scale", "jaws"], "source_section": "Vernier Callipers"},
    {"id": "sa010", "question": "What is pitch of a screw gauge?", "answer": "Pitch is the distance moved by the spindle of a screw gauge along its axis in one complete rotation of the circular scale. For a standard screw gauge, the pitch is 1 mm. It is used to calculate the least count: Least count = Pitch / Number of divisions on circular scale.", "key_points": ["Distance moved in one rotation", "Usually 1 mm", "Used to find least count"], "keywords": ["pitch", "rotation", "spindle"], "source_section": "Screw Gauge"},
    {"id": "sa011", "question": "What is a light year? Why is it used?", "answer": "A light year is the distance traveled by light in one year in vacuum, approximately 9.46 × 10^15 metres. It is used to measure extremely large astronomical distances between stars and galaxies because expressing such distances in metres or kilometres would require very large numbers.", "key_points": ["Distance light travels in 1 year", "9.46 × 10^15 m", "For astronomical distances"], "keywords": ["light year", "astronomical", "distance"], "source_section": "Large Units"},
    {"id": "sa012", "question": "What is meant by accuracy and precision in measurement?", "answer": "Accuracy refers to how close a measured value is to the true or actual value. Precision refers to how consistently an instrument gives the same reading when measurements are repeated. An instrument can be precise but not accurate, and vice versa.", "key_points": ["Accuracy: closeness to true value", "Precision: consistency of readings", "Both are independent"], "keywords": ["accuracy", "precision", "measurement"], "source_section": "Errors"}
