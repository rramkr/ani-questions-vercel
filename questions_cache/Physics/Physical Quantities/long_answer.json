      "question": "Describe the construction and working of a vernier callipers. Explain how to take a reading using it.",
      "answer": "**Construction of Vernier Callipers:**\n\n1. **Main Scale:** A steel ruler graduated in centimetres and millimetres. The smallest division (1 MSD) is usually 1 mm.\n\n2. **Vernier Scale:** A small scale with 10 divisions that slides along the main scale. 10 vernier divisions equal 9 mm (or 9 main scale divisions).\n\n3. **External Jaws:** Two jaws (one fixed to main scale, one to vernier scale) for measuring external dimensions of objects.\n\n4. **Internal Jaws:** Smaller jaws above the external jaws for measuring internal dimensions like inner diameter of tubes.\n\n5. **Depth Rod:** A thin rod attached to the vernier scale that extends to measure depth of containers or holes.\n\n6. **Locking Screw:** To fix the vernier scale position after measurement.\n\n**Working Principle:**\nThe vernier callipers works on the principle that a small difference between main scale and vernier scale divisions enables measurement of fractions of the smallest main scale division.\n\n**Taking a Reading:**\n\n1. **Note the zero error** (if any) when jaws are closed.\n\n2. **Place the object** between the external jaws (for external measurement).\n\n3. **Main Scale Reading (MSR):** Read the main scale division just before (to the left of) the zero of the vernier scale.\n\n4. **Vernier Scale Reading (VSR):** Count which vernier division coincides exactly with a main scale division.\n\n5. **Total Reading:** = MSR + (VSR × Least Count)\n   Where Least Count = 1 MSD - 1 VSD = 0.1 mm\n\n6. **Corrected Reading:** = Total Reading - Zero Error",

      "question": "Explain the construction and working of a screw gauge. How do you determine its least count?",
      "answer": "**Construction of Screw Gauge:**\n\n1. **U-shaped Frame:** A sturdy metal frame holding all components.\n\n2. **Anvil:** A fixed cylindrical stud on one side of the frame against which the object is placed.\n\n3. **Spindle:** A movable cylindrical rod that advances towards or retreats from the anvil when rotated.\n\n4. **Sleeve (Hub):** A hollow cylinder with a pitch scale (linear scale) graduated in millimetres.\n\n5. **Thimble:** A hollow cylinder that rotates over the sleeve. It contains the circular scale with usually 100 divisions.\n\n6. **Ratchet:** A device at the end of the thimble that ensures uniform pressure is applied, preventing damage to the object and ensuring accurate readings.\n\n**Working Principle:**\nThe screw gauge works on the principle of a screw. When the thimble is rotated through one complete turn, the spindle moves forward or backward by a distance equal to the pitch (usually 1 mm). The circular scale divides this motion into smaller parts.\n\n**Determining Least Count:**\n\nLeast Count = Pitch / Number of divisions on circular scale\n\nFor a standard screw gauge:\n- Pitch = 1 mm\n- Number of divisions = 100\n- Least Count = 1 mm / 100 = 0.01 mm = 10 micrometres\n\n**Taking a Reading:**\n\n1. Check for zero error when spindle touches anvil.\n2. Place the object between anvil and spindle.\n3. Rotate thimble using ratchet until it clicks.\n4. Note Pitch Scale Reading (PSR) - complete mm divisions visible.\n5. Note Circular Scale Reading (CSR) - division coinciding with reference line.\n6. Total Reading = PSR + (CSR × LC)\n7. Apply zero error correction.",

      "question": "What are the seven fundamental quantities in the SI system? Give their units and symbols. Why are they called fundamental?",
      "answer": "**The Seven SI Fundamental Quantities:**\n\n| Quantity | SI Unit | Symbol |\n|----------|---------|--------|\n| Length | Metre | m |\n| Mass | Kilogram | kg |\n| Time | Second | s |\n| Electric Current | Ampere | A |\n| Thermodynamic Temperature | Kelvin | K |\n| Amount of Substance | Mole | mol |\n| Luminous Intensity | Candela | cd |\n\n**Why They Are Called Fundamental:**\n\n1. **Independence:** These quantities are independent of each other. None of them can be expressed in terms of the others.\n\n2. **Basic Nature:** They are the most basic quantities required to describe physical phenomena. All other quantities are derived from these.\n\n3. **Cannot be Derived:** Unlike derived quantities (like velocity, force, or energy), fundamental quantities cannot be obtained from other quantities through mathematical operations.\n\n4. **Universal Application:** These seven quantities are sufficient to describe all physical measurements in all branches of science.\n\n5. **Defined Standards:** Each has a precisely defined standard that is internationally accepted and reproducible.\n\n**Definitions (Modern):**\n- Metre: Distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 second in vacuum\n- Kilogram: Defined using Planck's constant (since 2019)\n- Second: Duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of cesium-133 radiation\n- Ampere: Flow of 1/1.602176634 × 10^-19 elementary charges per second\n- Kelvin: Defined using Boltzmann constant\n- Mole: Contains exactly 6.02214076 × 10^23 elementary entities\n- Candela: Luminous intensity in given direction of a source emitting specific radiation",

      "question": "Explain dimensional analysis. What are its uses and limitations?",
      "answer": "**Dimensional Analysis:**\n\nDimensional analysis is a technique that uses the dimensions (fundamental quantities) of physical quantities to:\n- Analyse relationships between quantities\n- Check correctness of equations\n- Convert units\n- Derive possible relationships\n\n**Principle:** The dimensions on both sides of a correct physical equation must be the same (Principle of Homogeneity).\n\n**Dimensional Formulae Examples:**\n- Velocity: [M^0 L^1 T^-1] or [L T^-1]\n- Force: [M^1 L^1 T^-2] or [M L T^-2]\n- Energy: [M^1 L^2 T^-2] or [M L^2 T^-2]\n\n**Uses of Dimensional Analysis:**\n\n1. **Check Correctness of Equations:**\n   Example: v = u + at\n   LHS: [L T^-1]\n   RHS: [L T^-1] + [L T^-2][T] = [L T^-1] + [L T^-1] = [L T^-1]\n   Both sides match, so equation is dimensionally correct.\n\n2. **Derive Relationships:**\n   Can derive how quantities depend on each other (e.g., time period of pendulum depends on length and g).\n\n3. **Convert Units:**\n   Convert from one system (CGS) to another (SI) using dimensional relations.\n\n4. **Find Dimensions of Constants:**\n   Determine dimensions of physical constants in equations.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. **Cannot determine dimensionless constants:** Numerical factors like 2, π, ½ cannot be found.\n\n2. **Cannot distinguish between quantities with same dimensions:** Work and torque both have [M L^2 T^-2].\n\n3. **Cannot derive relations involving trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions.**\n\n4. **Not applicable if more than three unknown quantities are involved.**\n\n5. **Does not guarantee physical correctness:** A dimensionally correct equation may still be physically wrong.",

      "question": "Differentiate between accuracy and precision in measurements. Explain different types of errors in measurement.",
      "answer": "**Accuracy vs Precision:**\n\n**Accuracy:**\n- Refers to how close a measured value is to the TRUE or ACTUAL value\n- A measurement is accurate if it has small systematic error\n- Depends on the quality of instrument and technique\n- Example: If true length is 10.00 cm, a measurement of 9.99 cm is accurate\n\n**Precision:**\n- Refers to how CONSISTENT or REPRODUCIBLE measurements are\n- A measurement is precise if repeated measurements give similar values\n- Depends on the least count of the instrument\n- Example: Getting 9.50, 9.51, 9.49 cm repeatedly shows high precision\n\n**Key Difference:** A measurement can be precise but not accurate (consistent but wrong), or accurate but not precise (close to true value on average but varying).\n\n**Types of Errors:**\n\n**1. Systematic Errors:**\n- Consistent errors that shift all readings in one direction\n- Types:\n  a) **Instrumental errors:** Zero error, calibration errors, worn-out instruments\n  b) **Personal errors:** Parallax error, reaction time\n  c) **Environmental errors:** Temperature, humidity, pressure affecting instruments\n- Can be reduced by calibration and proper technique\n- Affect ACCURACY\n\n**2. Random Errors:**\n- Unpredictable errors that vary randomly\n- Caused by: human judgment, environmental fluctuations, electrical noise\n- Equal probability of positive and negative errors\n- Reduced by taking multiple readings and averaging\n- Affect PRECISION\n\n**3. Gross Errors:**\n- Blunders or mistakes by the observer\n- Examples: Wrong reading, recording errors, calculation mistakes\n- Avoided by careful observation and double-checking\n\n**Reducing Errors:**\n- Use proper instruments\n- Take multiple readings\n- Apply corrections for known errors\n- Use appropriate technique\n- Avoid parallax error",
