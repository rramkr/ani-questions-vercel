    {"id": "gr001", "question": "A screw gauge is more precise than a vernier callipers.", "answer": "A screw gauge has a smaller least count (0.01 mm) compared to vernier callipers (0.1 mm). The smaller the least count, the smaller the measurement that can be detected, making screw gauge more precise for measuring small dimensions.", "source_section": "Measuring Instruments"},
    {"id": "gr002", "question": "SI system is preferred over other systems of units.", "answer": "SI system is preferred because: (1) It is internationally accepted and used worldwide, (2) It is a coherent system where derived units are easily obtained from base units, (3) It uses decimal system making conversions simple, (4) It has unique symbols preventing confusion.", "source_section": "SI System"},
    {"id": "gr003", "question": "Light year is used to measure astronomical distances instead of metres.", "answer": "Astronomical distances are extremely large. Using metres would result in inconveniently large numbers (10^15 to 10^22). Light year (9.46 × 10^15 m) provides a more manageable scale for expressing distances between stars and galaxies.", "source_section": "Large Units"},
    {"id": "gr004", "question": "The ratchet is provided in a screw gauge.", "answer": "The ratchet ensures that uniform and limited pressure is applied to the object during measurement. This prevents: (1) Deformation of soft objects, (2) Damage to the instrument, (3) Variation in readings due to different pressures. It clicks when appropriate pressure is reached.", "source_section": "Screw Gauge"},
    {"id": "gr005", "question": "Zero error must be corrected in measuring instruments.", "answer": "Zero error causes systematic error in all measurements - every reading will be either higher (positive zero error) or lower (negative zero error) than the actual value. Without correction, all measurements would be inaccurate by the same fixed amount.", "source_section": "Errors"},
    {"id": "gr006", "question": "Multiple readings are taken and averaged in measurements.", "answer": "Taking multiple readings and averaging reduces random errors. Random errors are equally likely to be positive or negative, so they tend to cancel out when averaged. This improves the precision and reliability of the measurement.", "source_section": "Errors"},
    {"id": "gr007", "question": "Force is a derived quantity while mass is a fundamental quantity.", "answer": "Mass cannot be expressed in terms of other quantities - it is independent and basic. Force, however, can be expressed as mass × acceleration (F = ma), deriving from the fundamental quantities mass, length, and time.", "source_section": "Derived Quantities"},
    {"id": "gr008", "question": "Dimensional analysis cannot determine numerical constants in equations.", "answer": "Dimensions only deal with the nature of physical quantities (M, L, T), not with numerical values. Pure numbers like 2, π, ½, etc. are dimensionless and cannot be detected or determined through dimensional analysis.", "source_section": "Dimensional Analysis"},
    {"id": "gr009", "question": "Angle is considered a dimensionless quantity.", "answer": "Angle is defined as the ratio of arc length to radius: θ = s/r. Both arc length and radius have the dimension of length [L]. Therefore, θ = [L]/[L] = [L^0] = dimensionless.", "source_section": "Dimensions"},
    {"id": "gr010", "question": "The vernier callipers has both external and internal jaws.", "answer": "External jaws measure outside dimensions (length, diameter of solid objects). Internal jaws measure inside dimensions (internal diameter of pipes, tubes). Having both makes the vernier callipers versatile for different types of measurements.", "source_section": "Vernier Callipers"},
    {"id": "gr011", "question": "Specific gravity has no unit.", "answer": "Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of water. Specific gravity = ρ_substance/ρ_water = (kg/m³)/(kg/m³). The units cancel out, making it a pure ratio without any unit.", "source_section": "Derived Quantities"},
    {"id": "gr012", "question": "Work and torque have the same dimensions but are different quantities.", "answer": "Both have dimensions [M L^2 T^-2] and unit N·m. However, work is a scalar (energy transfer) calculated as force × displacement. Torque is a vector (rotational effect) calculated as force × perpendicular distance. Their physical meanings are completely different.", "source_section": "Dimensions"}
