    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is a list in Python?",
      "answer": "A list is a collection of data that can be ordered, unordered, changeable and allows duplicate members. It is defined using [] square brackets and items are separated using commas."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is the len() function used for?",
      "answer": "The len() function is used to find the number of items/elements in a list. For example, if numbers = [5, 67, 78, 65, 34], then len(numbers) returns 5."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What are positive index numbers in Python lists?",
      "answer": "Positive index numbers start from 0 for the first item in the list. The first item has position 0 (not 1 as in real world), second item has position 1, and so on."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What are negative index numbers in Python lists?",
      "answer": "Negative index numbers start with -1 for the last element. They allow us to access the list from the last. For example, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item, and so on."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is a condition in Python?",
      "answer": "A condition in Python compares two pieces of information using relational operators and always returns a Boolean (True/False) result. Conditions are used inside if-else statements."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "List all the relational operators in Python.",
      "answer": "The six relational operators in Python are: > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal to), < (lesser than), <= (lesser than or equal to), == (equal to), and != (not equal to)."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is the purpose of if-else statements?",
      "answer": "Conditional statements (if-else) in Python are used to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is indentation in Python?",
      "answer": "In Python, indentation is used to define blocks of code. All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block. It tells the Python interpreter which code is part of a block."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "How do you create indentation in Python?",
      "answer": "To indent code in Python, we insert a whitespace or tab key at the beginning of each line. This is required for loops and if-else conditions."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is iteration in Python?",
      "answer": "Iteration means to go through element by element. The for loop can be used to iterate through sequences such as strings and lists."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "What is the range() function?",
      "answer": "The range() function is used with for loops to repeat code a fixed number of times. It has three parameters: start, stop, and step. Start is inclusive, stop is exclusive (stops one before), and step is the increment value."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What happens when range() has only one argument?",
      "answer": "When range() has only one argument, that argument is the stop value, and the start value is by default 0. For example, range(5) produces 0, 1, 2, 3, 4."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "What happens when range() has two arguments?",
      "answer": "When range() has two arguments, they are the start and stop values, with no step (default step is 1). For example, range(3, 8) produces 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "How do you count backwards using range()?",
      "answer": "To count backwards, use a negative step value. For example, range(10, 0, -1) produces 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What is the time.sleep() function?",
      "answer": "The time.sleep() function adds a delay or pause in the program. time.sleep(1) pauses execution for 1 second. To use it, you must first import the time module."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is the modulus operator (%) used for?",
      "answer": "The modulus operator (%) gives the remainder of a division. For example, 10 % 3 = 1, and 8 % 2 = 0. It is commonly used to check if a number is even or odd."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "How do you check if a number is even in Python?",
      "answer": "To check if a number n is even, use the condition n % 2 == 0. If the remainder when dividing by 2 is 0, the number is even."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "What is the difference between = and == in Python?",
      "answer": "The = operator is used for assignment (storing a value in a variable), while == is used for comparison (checking if two values are equal). For example, a = 10 assigns 10 to a, while a == 10 checks if a equals 10."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "What is the syntax of a for loop in Python?",
      "answer": "The syntax is: for variable in sequence: followed by indented code. For example:\nfor x in range(5):\n    print(x)\nThe colon after the sequence is mandatory."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "What is the syntax of an if-else statement in Python?",
      "answer": "The syntax is:\nif (condition):\n    # True block statements\nelse:\n    # False block statements\nBoth if and else must end with a colon, and the code blocks must be indented."
    }
