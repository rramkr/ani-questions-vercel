      "question": "Where does Mr. Barton live? What sort of a man is he?",
      "answer": "Mr. Barton lives in a seaside town in England. He is an elderly man of 82 years who is thin and bald with thick spectacles. He is a pleasant, friendly person who loves antiques and enjoys spending his time searching for old treasures in second-hand shops and market stalls.",
      "justification": "The story describes him as 82, thin, bald with thick spectacles, and mentions he lives in a seaside town in England."

      "id": "tpf_tb_2",
      "question": "What sort of things does Mr. Barton like? Why, do you think, does he like such things?",
      "answer": "Mr. Barton likes old things, especially antiques such as old picture frames, Victorian biscuit tins, old furniture, silver candlesticks, and vintage clocks. He probably likes such things because they have character, history, and remind him of the past. As an elderly person, he may feel connected to objects from earlier times.",
      "justification": "The text lists his interests in antiques and old objects, showing his passion for things with history."

      "id": "tpf_tb_3",
      "question": "What was Mr. Barton doing in town that morning? What did he find and how much did he pay for it?",
      "answer": "That morning, Mr. Barton was wandering around town looking at the stalls and peering into shop windows in search of antiques. He found an ornate old picture frame with a dirty mirror in it. He paid twenty pounds for it after bargaining with the stallholder.",
      "justification": "The story describes his morning routine of hunting for antiques and the negotiation for the frame."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_tb_4",
      "question": "What did Mr. Barton find in the frame that he bought?",
      "answer": "After cleaning the frame at home, Mr. Barton discovered that behind the dirty old mirror was a beautiful oil painting. The painting showed a shepherd looking after his flock of sheep in a grassy field with hills and blue sky in the background.",
      "justification": "The text describes how he removed the mirror backing and found the hidden painting."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_tb_5",
      "question": "What do you think of the stallholder's claim that he himself had paid ten pounds for the frame?",
      "answer": "The stallholder's claim of paying ten pounds seems exaggerated and likely untrue. He was probably trying to justify his asking price of forty pounds and make Mr. Barton feel he was getting a fair deal. In reality, the stallholder had only paid two pounds for it, as revealed later in the story.",
      "justification": "The story later reveals the stallholder paid only two pounds, exposing his false claim."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_tb_6",
      "question": "Do you think Mr. Barton is a shrewd bargainer? Quote an example from the story to illustrate your view.",
      "answer": "Yes, Mr. Barton is definitely a shrewd bargainer. When the stallholder asked for forty pounds, Mr. Barton immediately spotted the flaws in the item, pointing out that the frame was scratched and the mirror was cracked. He then offered only twenty pounds, which was half the asking price, and succeeded in getting the item at that price.",
      "justification": "His bargaining technique of pointing out defects and offering half the price shows his negotiating skills."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_tb_7",
      "question": "Do you think that the stallholder would have charged more if the frame had not been scratched?",
      "answer": "Yes, the stallholder would definitely have charged more if the frame had not been scratched. The scratches and cracked mirror were obvious defects that reduced the value of the item. Without these flaws, the stallholder could have justified a higher price, and Mr. Barton would have had less room to negotiate.",
      "justification": "The defects gave Mr. Barton leverage to bargain; without them, the asking price would have been harder to reduce."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_tb_8",
      "question": "Do you think that the stallholder knew what was behind the mirror? Give reasons for your answer.",
      "answer": "No, the stallholder definitely did not know about the painting hidden behind the mirror. If he had known about the valuable artwork, he would never have sold the frame for just twenty pounds. The fact that he sold it so cheaply and had bought it himself for only two pounds shows he had no idea of its true value.",
      "justification": "His willingness to sell cheaply and his low purchase price prove he was unaware of the hidden treasure."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_tb_9",
      "question": "Why do you think the painting was hidden behind a mirror in the old frame?",
      "answer": "The painting was likely hidden behind the mirror to protect it or conceal it during difficult times. Perhaps the original owner wanted to safeguard the valuable artwork from thieves, or during wartime, people sometimes hid precious items. Another possibility is that someone didn't realize the painting's value and simply used the frame for a mirror.",
      "justification": "This requires inference about historical practices of hiding valuables for protection."
    },
    {
      "id": "tpf_tb_10",
      "question": "(HOTS) If you were in Mr. Barton's place, what would you do with the painting if you discovered it was priceless?",
      "answer": "If I were in Mr. Barton's place and discovered a priceless painting, I would first get it properly authenticated and valued by experts. Then I would consider my options carefully - I could sell it and use the money for good causes, or donate it to a museum so everyone could enjoy it. I might also keep it and will it to a museum, ensuring it's preserved for future generations while I enjoy it during my lifetime.",
      "justification": "This is a HOTS question requiring personal reflection and critical thinking about ethical choices."

      "answer": "Mr. Barton had unearthed a beautiful old oil painting that was hidden behind the dirty mirror. It is described as a 'treasure' because it turned out to be extremely valuable - worth half a million pounds. Also, for an antique lover like Mr. Barton, finding such a rare and beautiful painting is like discovering buried treasure.",
      "justification": "The painting's monetary value and its significance to an antique collector justify the term 'treasure'."
