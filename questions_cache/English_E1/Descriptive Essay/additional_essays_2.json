My stationery is organized in a small holder.\n\nMy study corner has comforting sounds and feelings. I hear the fan humming above. Sometimes I hear birds outside the window. The chair is comfortable and the table is just the right height. It feels like my personal space.\n\nMy study table is important because so much happens there. I do my homework, prepare for exams, and read my favorite books. Sometimes I just sit and think. It is where I feel most focused and productive.\n\nMy study corner is special because it is my personal space. It taught me that having an organized place helps you concentrate better. I will always take care of my study area."
