      "answer": "<b>Everyone has</b> heard about great people who changed the world. <b>For me</b>, the most important person in history is M. Chandrasekaran, a blind violin maestro. He is important because he achieved greatness despite not being able to see.\n\n<b>When we look</b> at M. Chandrasekaran on stage, we see a man with closed eyes playing the violin beautifully.

      "answer": "<b>Everyone has</b> looked at the night sky and wondered about other planets. <b>For me</b>, my favorite planet is Saturn. I dream of traveling there because it is the most beautiful planet in our solar system.\n\n<b>If I could see</b> Saturn up close, it would be amazing. The planet is a pale golden color with beautiful rings around it. These rings are made of ice and rock, millions of pieces floating in space. I would see the hexagon-shaped storm at its north pole, which is very strange and fascinating. Saturn has many moons, including Titan which has a thick orange atmosphere. Enceladus is another moon that sprays water into space like a fountain.\n\nIn my spaceship, I would hear the computers beeping and the machines humming. Scientists on Earth would talk to me through the radio, excited about what I am seeing. Space is silent, but inside the ship there would be many sounds. I would feel weightless and strange. Looking at Saturn's rings up close would be thrilling but also a little scary.\n\nSaturn fascinates me because it is so different from Earth. I have read a lot about the Cassini spacecraft that visited Saturn and sent back amazing photos. When I study science and math, I imagine that one day humans might actually travel to Saturn. Learning about space makes me curious to know more.\n\nThis imaginary journey <b>is special because</b> dreaming about distant places makes us want to learn more. <b>It taught me</b> that the universe is huge and full of wonders. <b>I will always</b> love Saturn and keep learning about space.",
