The fielders are spread around, ready to catch or stop the ball. The crowd waves flags and cheers.\n\nThe sounds of cricket are thrilling. <b>I hear</b> the crack of the bat hitting the ball. The crowd roars when a six is hit. The commentators describe every ball with excitement. I can almost feel the tension during close matches.\n\nCricket is meaningful to me because it brings people together. I play cricket with my friends after school. We form teams and have matches. Watching India play makes me feel proud and nervous at the same time.\n\nCricket <b>is special because</b> it teaches me about teamwork and handling pressure. <b>It taught me</b> that winning and losing are both part of the game. <b>I will always</b> love cricket."
