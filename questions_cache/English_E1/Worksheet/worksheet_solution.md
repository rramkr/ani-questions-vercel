## A. Idioms (5 marks)
*Underline the correct idiom to complete each sentence*

| Q | Sentence | Correct Answer | Justification |
|---|----------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | When Riya saw the surprise test paper, she was ___ | **in hot water** | "In hot water" means in trouble or difficulty. Seeing a surprise test would make someone worried/anxious, not happy. "Over the moon" means extremely happy, which doesn't fit this context. |
| 2 | Don't tell him the secret – he always ___ | **lets the cat out of the bag** | "Lets the cat out of the bag" means to reveal a secret accidentally or carelessly. "Hits the nail on the head" means to be exactly right about something. |
| 3 | After losing the match, the team decided to ___ | **call it a day** | "Call it a day" means to stop working/trying for now. After losing, the team decided to stop and rest. "Face the music" means to accept consequences, which would also fit, but "call it a day" is more appropriate for deciding to stop after a loss. |
| 4 | My brother is very lazy; he always ___ | **passes the buck** | "Passes the buck" means to shift responsibility to someone else, which lazy people often do. "Beats around the bush" means to avoid talking directly about something, not related to laziness. |
| 5 | The teacher asked us to ___ the new student | **keep an eye on** | "Keep an eye on" means to watch carefully or look after someone. "Spill the beans" means to reveal secret information, which doesn't fit the context of watching a new student. |

| 2. Where there is a will, there is a way | **c** | Hard work leads to success | If you have determination (will), you will find a method (way) to succeed. Determination and hard work lead to success. |

## C. Kinds of Sentences (5 marks)
*Identify the kind of sentence: Assertive, Interrogative, Imperative, or Exclamatory*

| Q | Sentence | Answer | Justification |
|---|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | What a beautiful painting this is! | **Exclamatory** | Expresses strong emotion (admiration) and ends with an exclamation mark. Exclamatory sentences express sudden feelings like joy, surprise, or wonder. |
| 2 | Please close the door quietly. | **Imperative** | Gives a command or request. Despite saying "please," it's still telling someone to do something. Imperative sentences give orders, requests, or advice. |

| 4 | Have you completed your homework? | **Interrogative** | Asks a question and ends with a question mark. Interrogative sentences seek information. |

*Convert the following sentences into Indirect Speech*

| Q | Direct Speech | Indirect Speech | Justification |
|---|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | She said, "I am feeling unwell today." | **She said that she was feeling unwell that day.** | Tense backshift: "am feeling" → "was feeling"; Pronoun change: "I" → "she"; Time change: "today" → "that day"; Add "that" as connector. |
| 2 | The teacher said, "Do not make noise in the class." | **The teacher ordered/instructed us not to make noise in the class.** | Negative command: "Do not" → "not to"; Reporting verb: "said" → "ordered/instructed"; Structure: ordered + object + not to + verb. |
| 3 | Ravi said to me, "I have finished my project." | **Ravi told me that he had finished his project.** | "Said to me" → "told me"; Tense backshift: "have finished" (present perfect) → "had finished" (past perfect); "I" → "he"; "my" → "his". |
| 4 | Mother said, "Where have you kept the keys?" | **Mother asked me where I had kept the keys.** | Wh-question: Keep the wh-word; "said" → "asked"; Statement word order (not question order); "have kept" → "had kept"; "you" → "I". |

*Change the voice of the following sentences*

| Q | Original | Changed Voice | Justification |
|---|----------|---------------|---------------|

|---|----------|--------|---------------|

| 2 | We reached the station ___ time. | **on** | "On time" is a fixed phrase meaning punctually, at the scheduled time. Not early, not late. |
| 3 | She is very good ___ mathematics. | **at** | "Good at" is the correct collocation for skills/subjects. We say "good at mathematics/sports/cooking." |
