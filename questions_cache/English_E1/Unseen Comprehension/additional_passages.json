      "passage": "Once upon a time, there lived an ant named Andy who lived in a colony beneath a large oak tree. Andy was smaller than the other ants, and some of them often teased him about his size. \"You'll never be able to carry big loads like us,\" they would say. But Andy refused to be discouraged.\n\nOne autumn day, the queen ant announced that the colony needed to gather enough food to survive the harsh winter. The ants scrambled in all directions, searching for food. Andy discovered a large piece of bread crumb near the garden fence. It was bigger than anything he had ever tried to carry.\n\n\"Leave it, Andy,\" laughed the bigger ants. \"You'll never manage it.\" But Andy had an idea. Instead of trying to lift the entire piece, he carefully broke it into smaller fragments. Then, he called out to the younger ants who were also considered too small to help.\n\nTogether, working as a team, they carried all the fragments back to the colony. The queen was impressed. \"Andy has shown us something valuable today,\" she declared. \"Success doesn't always come from being the biggest or strongest. It comes from being clever and working together.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Andy was respected by everyone in the colony. He had proved that determination and teamwork could overcome any obstacle.",

      "title": "The Magic of Libraries",
      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Libraries are more than just buildings filled with books. They are gateways to adventure, knowledge, and imagination. The first public library in the world was established in ancient Rome around 39 BC by Asinius Pollio. Since then, libraries have evolved tremendously, but their core purpose remains the same: to provide free access to information and learning for everyone.\n\nToday's modern libraries offer much more than books. They provide computers with internet access, audiobooks, DVDs, and even video games. Many libraries host events such as reading clubs, author talks, and educational workshops. Some libraries have makerspaces where people can learn to use 3D printers, sewing machines, and other creative tools.\n\nThe world's largest library is the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., USA. It holds more than 170 million items, including books, recordings, photographs, maps, and manuscripts. If you placed all the shelves in the Library of Congress end to end, they would stretch about 838 miles!\n\nLibrarians play a crucial role in these institutions. They are trained professionals who help visitors find the information they need. They also select which books and materials to add to the collection, organize community programs, and teach people how to research effectively.\n\nIn many communities, especially rural areas, libraries serve as important social centres where people gather, learn, and connect with others. During challenging times, libraries have adapted by offering online services, home delivery of books, and virtual programs. The library truly is a place where everyone is welcome, regardless of their background or circumstances.",

      "title": "The Honey Bee's Secret",
      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Honey bees are among the most fascinating creatures on Earth. These tiny insects live in highly organized societies called colonies, which can contain up to 60,000 bees. Each colony has three types of bees: the queen, worker bees, and drones. The queen's only job is to lay eggs—she can lay up to 2,000 eggs per day! Worker bees are all female and do all the work: collecting nectar, making honey, building the hive, and protecting the colony. Drones are male bees whose sole purpose is to mate with the queen.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about honey bees is how they communicate. When a worker bee finds a good source of flowers, she returns to the hive and performs a special \"waggle dance.\" This dance tells other bees exactly where to find the flowers. The direction of the waggle indicates the direction of the flowers relative to the sun, and the length of the waggle shows how far away the flowers are. Scientists consider this dance one of the most sophisticated forms of communication in the animal kingdom.\n\nHoney bees are incredibly important for our food supply. As they move from flower to flower collecting nectar, they transfer pollen, which helps plants produce fruits, vegetables, and seeds. This process is called pollination. It is estimated that one-third of the food we eat depends on pollination by bees.\n\nSadly, bee populations around the world are declining due to pesticides, habitat loss, and climate change. Scientists and farmers are working hard to protect these vital insects. Simple actions like planting bee-friendly flowers, avoiding pesticides in gardens, and supporting local beekeepers can help ensure that honey bees continue to thrive for generations to come.",

      "passage": "The Great Wall of China is one of the most impressive structures ever built by humans. Stretching approximately 21,196 kilometres across northern China, it is the longest wall in the world. The wall was built over many centuries, with construction beginning as early as the 7th century BC. However, most of the existing wall was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD).\n\nThe primary purpose of the Great Wall was to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes from the north. The wall features watchtowers positioned at regular intervals, which were used to send smoke signals during the day and fire signals at night to warn of approaching enemies. Soldiers lived in these watchtowers and guarded the wall day and night.\n\nBuilding the Great Wall was an enormous undertaking that involved millions of workers. These workers included soldiers, peasants, and prisoners. The working conditions were extremely harsh, and it is estimated that over one million people died during the construction. The materials used to build the wall varied depending on the region: in the mountains, workers used local stone; in the desert areas, they used compacted earth and sand; and in some sections, they used bricks held together with sticky rice mortar.\n\nToday, the Great Wall is one of China's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors each year. In 1987, UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site. Although parts of the wall have fallen into disrepair over the centuries, conservation efforts are ongoing to preserve this magnificent monument. Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall cannot be seen from space with the naked eye—this is a common myth that has been disproved by astronauts.",

      "passage": "In today's digital age, with instant messaging, emails, and social media at our fingertips, the art of letter writing has become almost obsolete. Yet, there was a time when handwritten letters were the primary means of communication between people separated by distance. These letters were treasured keepsakes, often tied with ribbons and stored in special boxes to be read and reread over the years.\n\nHistorical letters have provided historians with invaluable insights into the past. The letters of famous figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, and Vincent van Gogh offer glimpses into their thoughts, feelings, and the times in which they lived. Some of history's most beautiful and moving words were penned in personal letters never meant for public eyes.\n\nThe process of writing a letter is vastly different from sending a quick text message. It requires thought, patience, and effort. The writer must carefully choose their words, knowing that the recipient will hold the physical paper in their hands. The handwriting itself becomes personal—each person's script is unique, like a fingerprint. Even the choice of stationery and the colour of ink adds a personal touch that no digital message can replicate.\n\nInterestingly, there has been a small revival of letter writing in recent years. Some people have discovered the joy of corresponding through \"pen pal\" programmes, while others have taken up calligraphy as a hobby. Psychologists have found that receiving a handwritten letter triggers a stronger emotional response than receiving an email or text message. The tangible nature of a letter makes it more meaningful and memorable.\n\nPerhaps in our fast-paced world, the slow, deliberate act of writing a letter offers a welcome pause—a chance to reflect deeply and express ourselves more thoughtfully than a hastily typed message ever could.",
