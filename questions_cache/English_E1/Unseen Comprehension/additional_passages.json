      "passage": "Once upon a time, there lived an ant named Andy who lived in a colony beneath a large oak tree. Andy was smaller than the other ants, and some of them often teased him about his size. \"You'll never be able to carry big loads like us,\" they would say. But Andy refused to be discouraged.\n\nOne autumn day, the queen ant announced that the colony needed to gather enough food to survive the harsh winter. The ants scrambled in all directions, searching for food. Andy discovered a large piece of bread crumb near the garden fence. It was bigger than anything he had ever tried to carry.\n\n\"Leave it, Andy,\" laughed the bigger ants. \"You'll never manage it.\" But Andy had an idea. Instead of trying to lift the entire piece, he carefully broke it into smaller fragments. Then, he called out to the younger ants who were also considered too small to help.\n\nTogether, working as a team, they carried all the fragments back to the colony. The queen was impressed. \"Andy has shown us something valuable today,\" she declared. \"Success doesn't always come from being the biggest or strongest. It comes from being clever and working together.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Andy was respected by everyone in the colony. He had proved that determination and teamwork could overcome any obstacle.",

      "title": "The Magic of Libraries",
      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Libraries are more than just buildings filled with books. They are gateways to adventure, knowledge, and imagination. The first public library in the world was established in ancient Rome around 39 BC by Asinius Pollio. Since then, libraries have evolved tremendously, but their core purpose remains the same: to provide free access to information and learning for everyone.\n\nToday's modern libraries offer much more than books. They provide computers with internet access, audiobooks, DVDs, and even video games. Many libraries host events such as reading clubs, author talks, and educational workshops. Some libraries have makerspaces where people can learn to use 3D printers, sewing machines, and other creative tools.\n\nThe world's largest library is the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., USA. It holds more than 170 million items, including books, recordings, photographs, maps, and manuscripts. If you placed all the shelves in the Library of Congress end to end, they would stretch about 838 miles!\n\nLibrarians play a crucial role in these institutions. They are trained professionals who help visitors find the information they need. They also select which books and materials to add to the collection, organize community programs, and teach people how to research effectively.\n\nIn many communities, especially rural areas, libraries serve as important social centres where people gather, learn, and connect with others. During challenging times, libraries have adapted by offering online services, home delivery of books, and virtual programs. The library truly is a place where everyone is welcome, regardless of their background or circumstances.",

      "title": "The Honey Bee's Secret",
      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Honey bees are among the most fascinating creatures on Earth. These tiny insects live in highly organized societies called colonies, which can contain up to 60,000 bees. Each colony has three types of bees: the queen, worker bees, and drones. The queen's only job is to lay eggs—she can lay up to 2,000 eggs per day! Worker bees are all female and do all the work: collecting nectar, making honey, building the hive, and protecting the colony. Drones are male bees whose sole purpose is to mate with the queen.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about honey bees is how they communicate. When a worker bee finds a good source of flowers, she returns to the hive and performs a special \"waggle dance.\" This dance tells other bees exactly where to find the flowers. The direction of the waggle indicates the direction of the flowers relative to the sun, and the length of the waggle shows how far away the flowers are. Scientists consider this dance one of the most sophisticated forms of communication in the animal kingdom.\n\nHoney bees are incredibly important for our food supply. As they move from flower to flower collecting nectar, they transfer pollen, which helps plants produce fruits, vegetables, and seeds. This process is called pollination. It is estimated that one-third of the food we eat depends on pollination by bees.\n\nSadly, bee populations around the world are declining due to pesticides, habitat loss, and climate change. Scientists and farmers are working hard to protect these vital insects. Simple actions like planting bee-friendly flowers, avoiding pesticides in gardens, and supporting local beekeepers can help ensure that honey bees continue to thrive for generations to come.",

      "passage": "The Great Wall of China is one of the most impressive structures ever built by humans. Stretching approximately 21,196 kilometres across northern China, it is the longest wall in the world. The wall was built over many centuries, with construction beginning as early as the 7th century BC. However, most of the existing wall was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD).\n\nThe primary purpose of the Great Wall was to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes from the north. The wall features watchtowers positioned at regular intervals, which were used to send smoke signals during the day and fire signals at night to warn of approaching enemies. Soldiers lived in these watchtowers and guarded the wall day and night.\n\nBuilding the Great Wall was an enormous undertaking that involved millions of workers. These workers included soldiers, peasants, and prisoners. The working conditions were extremely harsh, and it is estimated that over one million people died during the construction. The materials used to build the wall varied depending on the region: in the mountains, workers used local stone; in the desert areas, they used compacted earth and sand; and in some sections, they used bricks held together with sticky rice mortar.\n\nToday, the Great Wall is one of China's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors each year. In 1987, UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site. Although parts of the wall have fallen into disrepair over the centuries, conservation efforts are ongoing to preserve this magnificent monument. Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall cannot be seen from space with the naked eye—this is a common myth that has been disproved by astronauts.",

These letters were treasured keepsakes, often tied with ribbons and stored in special boxes to be read and reread over the years.\n\nHistorical letters have provided historians with invaluable insights into the past. The letters of famous figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, and Vincent van Gogh offer glimpses into their thoughts, feelings, and the times in which they lived. Some of history's most beautiful and moving words were penned in personal letters never meant for public eyes.\n\nThe process of writing a letter is vastly different from sending a quick text message. It requires thought, patience, and effort. The writer must carefully choose their words, knowing that the recipient will hold the physical paper in their hands. The handwriting itself becomes personal—each person's script is unique, like a fingerprint. Even the choice of stationery and the colour of ink adds a personal touch that no digital message can replicate.\n\nInterestingly, there has been a small revival of letter writing in recent years. Some people have discovered the joy of corresponding through \"pen pal\" programmes, while others have taken up calligraphy as a hobby. Psychologists have found that receiving a handwritten letter triggers a stronger emotional response than receiving an email or text message. The tangible nature of a letter makes it more meaningful and memorable.\n\nPerhaps in our fast-paced world, the slow, deliberate act of writing a letter offers a welcome pause—a chance to reflect deeply and express ourselves more thoughtfully than a hastily typed message ever could.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "The human brain is the most complex organ in the known universe. Weighing only about 1.4 kilograms, it contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others, forming an intricate network of trillions of connections. This remarkable organ controls everything we do—from breathing and heartbeat to thinking, feeling, and dreaming.\n\nThe brain is divided into different regions, each responsible for specific functions. The frontal lobe, located at the front of the brain, handles reasoning, planning, and decision-making. The temporal lobe processes sounds and helps with language comprehension. The parietal lobe integrates sensory information, while the occipital lobe at the back processes visual information.\n\nOne fascinating aspect of the brain is its plasticity—its ability to change and adapt throughout our lives. When we learn something new, our brain forms new neural connections. This is why practice makes perfect: the more we repeat an activity, the stronger those neural pathways become. Even after injury, the brain can sometimes rewire itself to compensate for damaged areas.\n\nThe brain consumes about 20% of our body's energy, despite making up only 2% of our body weight. It requires a constant supply of oxygen and glucose to function properly. Just five minutes without oxygen can cause permanent brain damage. This is why maintaining good cardiovascular health through exercise and proper nutrition is essential for brain health.\n\nScientists continue to unlock the mysteries of the brain. Recent research has shown that sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation and brain detoxification. During sleep, the brain clears out waste products that accumulate during waking hours. This discovery has reinforced the importance of getting adequate sleep for cognitive function and overall health.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Chocolate, one of the world's most beloved treats, has a rich history that spans over 4,000 years. The story begins in ancient Mesoamerica, where the Maya and Aztec civilizations cultivated cacao trees and considered the beans so valuable that they were used as currency. The Aztec emperor Montezuma reportedly drank fifty cups of a bitter cacao beverage daily, believing it gave him strength and wisdom.\n\nWhen Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Americas in the 16th century, they brought cacao beans back to Europe. Initially, chocolate was consumed only as a drink and was considered a luxury for the wealthy. It wasn't until the 19th century that solid chocolate bars were invented. In 1847, Joseph Fry created the first modern chocolate bar by mixing cocoa powder with sugar and cocoa butter.\n\nThe journey from cacao tree to chocolate bar is a complex process. Cacao trees grow only in tropical regions within 20 degrees of the equator. The trees produce large pods containing 30-50 cacao beans surrounded by sweet pulp. After harvesting, the beans undergo fermentation, drying, roasting, and grinding. The resulting cocoa mass is then processed into cocoa powder and cocoa butter, which are combined with sugar and milk to create the chocolate we know today.\n\nToday, chocolate is a global industry worth over 130 billion dollars annually. The largest producers of cacao are Ivory Coast and Ghana in West Africa, which together account for over 60% of the world's supply. However, the industry faces challenges including climate change, which threatens cacao-growing regions, and concerns about fair wages for farmers. Many companies are now working towards sustainable and ethical chocolate production.",

      "passage": "The Olympic Games are the world's foremost sports competition, bringing together thousands of athletes from around the globe to compete in the spirit of friendship and fair play. The ancient Olympics began in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, as a religious festival honouring Zeus. Athletes competed in events like running, wrestling, and chariot racing. The games were held every four years for nearly 1,200 years until they were banned in 393 AD.\n\nThe modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896 by Pierre de Coubertin, a French educator who believed that sports could promote peace and international understanding. The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, with 241 athletes from 14 nations competing in 43 events. Today, the Summer Olympics feature over 10,000 athletes from more than 200 countries competing in over 300 events.\n\nThe Olympic symbols carry deep meaning. The five interlocking rings represent the five inhabited continents—Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania—united by the Olympic movement. The Olympic flame, lit in Olympia and carried by relay to the host city, symbolizes the connection between the ancient and modern games. The Olympic motto, 'Citius, Altius, Fortius' (Faster, Higher, Stronger), was recently updated to include 'Communiter' (Together).\n\nHosting the Olympics is a massive undertaking that requires years of preparation and billions of dollars in investment. Cities compete fiercely for the honour, as the games can boost tourism, infrastructure development, and national pride. However, the legacy of the Olympics extends beyond medals and records. The games inspire millions of young people to pursue sports and remind us of what humanity can achieve when nations come together in peaceful competition.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "The octopus is one of the most intelligent and fascinating creatures in the ocean. These remarkable animals have three hearts, blue blood, and eight flexible arms lined with powerful suction cups. Unlike most animals, octopuses have no bones, allowing them to squeeze through incredibly tight spaces—an octopus can fit through any opening larger than its beak, the only hard part of its body.\n\nOctopuses are masters of camouflage. They can change their colour, pattern, and even texture in milliseconds to blend into their surroundings. Special cells called chromatophores contain pigments that expand or contract to create different colours, while other cells reflect light to produce shimmering effects. This ability helps octopuses hide from predators and sneak up on prey.\n\nThe intelligence of octopuses has amazed scientists. They can solve puzzles, open jars, use tools, and even recognize individual human faces. In laboratories, octopuses have been observed escaping from tanks, navigating mazes, and showing distinct personalities. Their intelligence is particularly remarkable because octopuses are solitary creatures—unlike social animals, they cannot learn from others.\n\nSadly, octopuses have short lifespans, typically living only one to two years. After mating, female octopuses guard their eggs for months without eating, often dying shortly after the eggs hatch. This dedication to their offspring is one of the many mysteries surrounding these enigmatic creatures. Scientists continue to study octopuses, hoping to understand how such intelligence evolved in an animal so different from humans.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Music is a universal language that transcends cultural boundaries and speaks directly to the human soul. Every known human culture, past and present, has created music in some form. Archaeological evidence suggests that humans have been making music for at least 40,000 years, with bone flutes being among the oldest musical instruments ever discovered.\n\nThe effects of music on the human brain are profound. When we listen to music we enjoy, our brains release dopamine, a chemical associated with pleasure and reward. This is the same chemical released when we eat delicious food or receive a hug. Music can also reduce cortisol, the stress hormone, which explains why people often turn to music to relax or cope with difficult emotions.\n\nBeyond emotional effects, music has been shown to improve cognitive function. Students who study music often perform better in mathematics, possibly because both disciplines involve recognizing patterns and relationships. Learning to play an instrument strengthens connections between different parts of the brain and can even increase IQ. For elderly patients, music therapy has been effective in slowing cognitive decline and helping those with dementia recall memories.\n\nMusic also has remarkable healing properties. Hospitals around the world use music therapy to help patients manage pain, reduce anxiety before surgery, and recover faster. Premature babies exposed to soothing music in intensive care units show improved sleep patterns and faster weight gain. Whether we're listening, singing, or playing an instrument, music has the power to heal, inspire, and bring people together in ways that few other things can.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is one of Earth's most important natural processes. It describes the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. The same water that dinosaurs drank millions of years ago is still cycling through our planet today—water is neither created nor destroyed, only recycled.\n\nThe cycle begins with evaporation, when the sun's heat causes water from oceans, lakes, and rivers to turn into water vapour and rise into the atmosphere. Plants also contribute through a process called transpiration, releasing water vapour through their leaves. Together, evaporation and transpiration add enormous amounts of moisture to the air—about 500,000 cubic kilometres annually.\n\nAs water vapour rises, it cools and condenses into tiny water droplets that form clouds. This process is called condensation. When these droplets combine and become heavy enough, they fall back to Earth as precipitation—rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Most precipitation falls directly into the oceans, but some falls on land.\n\nWater that falls on land takes several paths. Some flows across the surface as runoff, eventually reaching streams and rivers that carry it back to the ocean. Some soaks into the ground, becoming groundwater that moves slowly through soil and rock. This groundwater can remain underground for thousands of years before emerging in springs or being pumped up by wells. The water cycle is crucial for life on Earth, distributing fresh water, regulating temperature, and shaping landscapes through erosion.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, known as Mahatma Gandhi, was one of the most influential leaders in world history. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, he would become the father of Indian independence and inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The title 'Mahatma,' meaning 'great soul,' was given to him by the Indian people as a mark of their respect and love.\n\nGandhi studied law in London and then moved to South Africa, where he experienced racial discrimination firsthand. It was in South Africa that he developed his philosophy of Satyagraha, or nonviolent resistance. He believed that truth and love could conquer hatred and injustice without resorting to violence. This approach would become his most powerful weapon against British colonial rule in India.\n\nReturning to India in 1915, Gandhi led numerous campaigns against British rule. He encouraged Indians to spin their own cloth using the charkha (spinning wheel) to boycott British textiles. He led the famous Salt March in 1930, walking 385 kilometres to the sea to make salt, defying British laws that taxed this essential commodity. His methods of peaceful protest inspired millions.\n\nGandhi lived simply, wearing only hand-spun cloth and eating a vegetarian diet. He believed in equality for all, fighting against the discrimination faced by untouchables, whom he called 'Harijans' or 'children of God.' His life's work culminated in Indian independence on August 15, 1947. Tragically, Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy of nonviolent resistance continues to inspire leaders and movements worldwide.",

      "passage": "The Amazon Rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest on Earth, covering approximately 5.5 million square kilometres across nine South American countries. Often called the 'lungs of the Earth,' the Amazon produces about 20% of the world's oxygen and plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate. The forest is home to the Amazon River, which carries more water than any other river in the world.\n\nThe biodiversity of the Amazon is staggering. Scientists estimate that the forest contains about 10% of all species on Earth. There are approximately 80,000 plant species, 1,300 bird species, 3,000 types of fish, and countless insects—many of which have not yet been discovered or named. New species are found regularly; between 2014 and 2015, scientists discovered an average of one new species every two days.\n\nIndigenous peoples have lived in the Amazon for thousands of years, developing extensive knowledge of the forest's plants and animals. Many modern medicines have been developed from plants first used by indigenous communities. The rosy periwinkle, for example, provides compounds used to treat cancer. Scientists believe that many more medicinal plants remain undiscovered in the Amazon.\n\nUnfortunately, the Amazon faces severe threats from deforestation. Approximately 17% of the forest has been lost in the last 50 years, mainly due to cattle ranching, agriculture, and logging. Deforestation not only destroys habitats but also releases stored carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Conservation efforts are underway, but protecting this vital ecosystem requires global cooperation and commitment.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "The telephone is one of the most transformative inventions in human history, revolutionising the way people communicate across distances. On March 10, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell made the first successful telephone call, speaking the famous words to his assistant: 'Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.' This moment marked the beginning of a new era in communication.\n\nBell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1847. His mother and wife were both deaf, which inspired his lifelong interest in speech and sound. Before inventing the telephone, Bell worked as a teacher of the deaf and studied the mechanics of human speech. His understanding of sound waves and vibrations was crucial to his invention of the telephone.\n\nThe telephone worked by converting sound waves into electrical signals that could travel through wires. When someone spoke into the phone, their voice caused a thin metal disc to vibrate. These vibrations were converted into electrical pulses that travelled through wires to the receiving phone, where they were converted back into sound waves. This basic principle remains at the heart of telephone technology today.\n\nInitially, many people were sceptical about the telephone's usefulness. Western Union, the telegraph company, famously turned down Bell's offer to sell his patent for $100,000, calling the telephone a 'toy.' Within just a few years, however, telephones were being installed in homes and businesses across America. By 1900, there were nearly 600,000 phones in the United States alone. Today, billions of people around the world carry smartphones that would have seemed like science fiction to Bell.",

These vibrations were converted into electrical pulses that travelled through wires and were converted back into sound waves at the receiving phone."

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Sleep is not merely a period of rest; it is a vital biological process that affects nearly every aspect of our health and well-being. During sleep, our bodies and brains undergo essential maintenance and restoration that cannot happen while we are awake. Despite spending roughly one-third of our lives asleep, scientists are still uncovering the mysteries of why we need sleep.\n\nThe sleep cycle consists of several stages that repeat throughout the night. Non-REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep includes light sleep and deep sleep, during which the body repairs tissues, builds muscle, and strengthens the immune system. REM sleep, characterised by rapid eye movements and vivid dreams, is crucial for memory consolidation and emotional processing. A typical night includes four to six complete cycles.\n\nSleep deprivation has serious consequences. In the short term, lack of sleep impairs concentration, memory, and decision-making. It also affects mood, making people more irritable and prone to anxiety. Long-term sleep deprivation is linked to serious health problems including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and weakened immunity. Studies show that people who regularly sleep less than seven hours per night have a 12% higher risk of premature death.\n\nFor adolescents, sleep is especially important as their brains are still developing. Experts recommend that teenagers get eight to ten hours of sleep per night, yet most get far less due to early school start times, homework, and screen use before bed. Creating good sleep habits—such as maintaining a regular bedtime, avoiding screens before sleep, and keeping bedrooms cool and dark—can dramatically improve both health and academic performance.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is widely considered one of the most beautiful buildings ever created. This stunning white marble mausoleum was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631 while giving birth to their fourteenth child. The emperor was so grief-stricken that his hair reportedly turned grey overnight.\n\nConstruction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and took approximately 22 years to complete. The project employed over 20,000 workers, including architects, stone-cutters, carvers, painters, and calligraphers from across Asia. The white marble was brought from Rajasthan, while precious stones for the intricate inlay work came from as far as China, Tibet, and Sri Lanka. The total cost of construction is estimated at around 32 million rupees at that time.\n\nThe architecture of the Taj Mahal represents a perfect blend of Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles. The building is perfectly symmetrical, with four identical faces and a massive central dome reaching 73 metres in height. The interior walls are decorated with delicate floral patterns and verses from the Quran, inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones. The gardens surrounding the Taj Mahal are designed in the traditional Mughal 'charbagh' style, divided into four sections by waterways.\n\nToday, the Taj Mahal attracts between seven and eight million visitors annually and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. However, the monument faces threats from air pollution, which has begun to yellow the white marble. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this treasure for future generations.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Ants are among the most successful creatures on Earth, having existed for over 100 million years. These tiny insects live on every continent except Antarctica and are found in almost every environment, from rainforests to deserts. Scientists estimate there are over 12,000 species of ants, with a total population of approximately 20 quadrillion individuals—that's about 2.5 million ants for every human on the planet!\n\nAnt colonies are highly organised societies with a strict division of labour. The queen's sole purpose is to lay eggs—some queens can live for 30 years and lay millions of eggs. Worker ants, all female, perform various tasks including foraging for food, caring for young, and defending the colony. Male ants exist only to mate with the queen and typically die shortly afterward.\n\nAnts are remarkably strong for their size. They can carry objects 10 to 50 times their own body weight. If humans had the same strength relative to our size, an average person could lift a car! Ants achieve this through their small size, which gives them a favourable strength-to-weight ratio, and their powerful muscles.\n\nCommunication among ants relies heavily on chemical signals called pheromones. When a worker ant finds food, it leaves a pheromone trail for others to follow. Different pheromones signal danger, mark territory, or identify colony members. Some ant species also communicate through sounds and touch. This sophisticated communication system allows thousands of ants to work together seamlessly, building complex nests, farming fungus, or even waging war against rival colonies.",

The Sun's gravitational pull keeps eight planets, numerous dwarf planets, and countless smaller objects in orbit around it. The solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust.\n\nThe eight planets are divided into two groups based on their composition. The inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky worlds with solid surfaces. These terrestrial planets are relatively small and dense. The outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are giant worlds made mostly of gas and ice. Jupiter, the largest planet, could fit all the other planets inside it with room to spare.\n\nEarth occupies a special position in our solar system known as the 'habitable zone' or 'Goldilocks zone,' where temperatures are just right for liquid water to exist. This, combined with our protective atmosphere and magnetic field, has allowed life to flourish on our planet. Scientists are discovering similar zones around other stars, raising exciting possibilities for life elsewhere in the universe.\n\nBeyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region containing millions of icy bodies including the dwarf planet Pluto. Even farther out is the Oort Cloud, a vast spherical shell of icy objects that marks the outer boundary of our solar system.

      "passage": "Football, known as soccer in some countries, is the world's most popular sport, with an estimated four billion fans globally. The modern game originated in England in the 19th century, but ball-kicking games have existed for thousands of years. Ancient civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, and Central America all had games involving kicking a ball, though the rules varied greatly.\n\nThe Football Association was founded in London in 1863, establishing the first standardised rules for the sport. These rules separated football from rugby, which allowed handling the ball. The first official international match was played between England and Scotland in 1872, ending in a 0-0 draw. The sport spread rapidly through British colonies and trade routes, eventually becoming truly global.\n\nThe FIFA World Cup, first held in 1930 in Uruguay, is now the world's most-watched sporting event. The tournament takes place every four years and brings together national teams from around the world. Brazil has won the most World Cups with five titles, followed by Germany and Italy with four each. The tournament attracts billions of viewers, with the 2018 final watched by an estimated 1.1 billion people.\n\nFootball has produced legendary players who have become global icons. Pelé of Brazil is often considered the greatest player of the 20th century, while Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have dominated the modern era. The sport has the power to unite people across national, cultural, and social boundaries, creating moments of shared joy and heartbreak that few other activities can match.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Butterflies are among nature's most beautiful and fascinating creatures, undergoing one of the most remarkable transformations in the animal kingdom. The process, called metamorphosis, takes a butterfly through four distinct stages: egg, caterpillar (larva), chrysalis (pupa), and adult butterfly. This complete transformation takes anywhere from a few weeks to several months, depending on the species.\n\nThe monarch butterfly is famous for its incredible migration. Each autumn, millions of monarchs travel up to 4,800 kilometres from Canada and the United States to their winter homes in the mountains of central Mexico. Amazingly, no single butterfly completes the entire round trip. It takes three to four generations to make the journey north, yet somehow the great-great-grandchildren of the original migrants find their way back to the exact same trees their ancestors left months earlier.\n\nButterflies play important roles in ecosystems as pollinators and as food for other animals. They have evolved remarkable adaptations for survival. Some species have wing patterns that mimic the eyes of larger animals to frighten predators. Others have developed colours and patterns that make them look like poisonous species, a strategy called mimicry. The blue morpho butterfly's brilliant colour comes not from pigment but from microscopic scales that reflect light.\n\nSadly, butterfly populations worldwide are declining due to habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. The monarch population alone has decreased by approximately 90% over the past two decades. Conservation efforts include creating butterfly gardens, reducing pesticide use, and protecting migration corridors. Everyone can help by planting native flowers that provide nectar for adult butterflies and food plants for caterpillars.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 is considered one of the most important events in human history. Before Gutenberg, books had to be copied by hand, a painstaking process that could take months or even years for a single book. Books were therefore rare and expensive, accessible only to the wealthy and the clergy. Gutenberg's invention changed everything.\n\nGutenberg's key innovation was movable type—individual letters cast in metal that could be arranged to form words, then rearranged to print different pages. This was combined with a wooden press adapted from those used in wine-making, and oil-based ink that adhered well to the metal type. The first major work printed using this technology was the Gutenberg Bible, completed around 1455, of which 49 copies still exist today.\n\nThe impact of the printing press was revolutionary. Within 50 years of Gutenberg's invention, printing presses had been established throughout Europe, and millions of books had been produced. Literacy rates soared as books became affordable for the middle class. Scientific knowledge could be shared more widely and accurately, accelerating the pace of discovery. The Protestant Reformation was aided by the ability to print and distribute pamphlets and translated Bibles.\n\nThe printing press laid the foundation for the modern information age. Newspapers, magazines, and mass education all became possible because of this technology. Today, while digital media has transformed how we access information, the principles Gutenberg established—making knowledge accessible to everyone—remain at the heart of our information society.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Stars, the luminous objects that light up our night sky, are born, live, and die over timescales that dwarf human comprehension. The life of a star begins in vast clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. When parts of these clouds become dense enough, gravity causes them to collapse and heat up. When the core temperature reaches about 15 million degrees Celsius, nuclear fusion begins, and a star is born.\n\nDuring most of its life, a star fuses hydrogen atoms into helium in its core, releasing enormous amounts of energy. This stage, called the main sequence, can last millions to billions of years depending on the star's mass. Our Sun, a medium-sized star, has been in its main sequence for about 4.6 billion years and will continue for another 5 billion years.\n\nWhat happens next depends on the star's mass. Medium-sized stars like our Sun will expand into red giants, eventually shedding their outer layers to form beautiful planetary nebulae while their cores become dense white dwarfs. Massive stars have more dramatic fates. They explode as supernovae, some of the most energetic events in the universe, briefly outshining entire galaxies.\n\nThe remnants of massive stars can become neutron stars—incredibly dense objects where a teaspoon of material weighs billions of tons—or black holes, regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Remarkably, the elements created in dying stars are scattered across space and eventually form new stars, planets, and even life. As astronomer Carl Sagan said, we are all made of 'star stuff.'",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Coral reefs are often called the 'rainforests of the sea' because of their incredible biodiversity. Although they cover less than 1% of the ocean floor, coral reefs are home to approximately 25% of all marine species. These underwater ecosystems support fish, sea turtles, sharks, dolphins, and countless invertebrates, creating complex food webs that rival any terrestrial ecosystem.\n\nCorals themselves are actually animals, not plants. Each coral is made up of thousands of tiny creatures called polyps, which are related to jellyfish. Most reef-building corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae that live within their tissues. The algae produce food through photosynthesis and give corals their vibrant colours, while the coral provides protection and nutrients to the algae.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia is the world's largest coral reef system, stretching over 2,300 kilometres and visible from space. It contains over 2,900 individual reefs and supports more than 1,500 species of fish. The reef is so large that it has its own weather patterns and generates significant economic activity through tourism and fishing.\n\nSadly, coral reefs worldwide are under severe threat. Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, where stressed corals expel their symbiotic algae and turn white. Ocean acidification, caused by absorbing carbon dioxide, makes it harder for corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons. Scientists estimate that 50% of the world's coral reefs have already been lost, and without significant action on climate change, 90% could be gone by 2050.",

      "passage": "Every night, as we sleep, our minds create vivid worlds filled with strange events, familiar faces, and impossible scenarios. Dreams have fascinated humans since ancient times, inspiring art, literature, and scientific inquiry. Yet despite centuries of study, the true purpose and meaning of dreams remain among the greatest mysteries of the human mind.\n\nDreams occur primarily during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a stage characterized by quick eye movements, increased brain activity, and temporary muscle paralysis. Most people have four to six dream episodes per night, though we typically remember only a fraction of them. The longest and most vivid dreams usually occur in the final hours of sleep, which is why we often remember dreams when we wake up naturally.\n\nScientists have proposed various theories about why we dream. Some believe dreams help consolidate memories, transferring important information from short-term to long-term storage. Others suggest dreams allow us to process emotions, working through fears and anxieties in a safe mental space. The threat simulation theory proposes that dreams evolved to help our ancestors practice responding to dangers. More recently, researchers have suggested dreams might help the brain maintain neural connections and remove unnecessary information.\n\nLucid dreaming, where the dreamer becomes aware they are dreaming and can sometimes control the dream, has attracted considerable scientific interest. Studies show that lucid dreamers can signal to researchers using pre-arranged eye movements, proving consciousness during sleep. This phenomenon offers unique opportunities to study the nature of consciousness and the relationship between the sleeping and waking mind.",

      "title": "The Story of Tea",
      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water, with billions of cups drunk every day. The story of tea begins in ancient China, where legend says Emperor Shen Nung discovered it in 2737 BC when tea leaves accidentally blew into his pot of boiling water. Whether or not this legend is true, tea has been cultivated in China for thousands of years and has become deeply embedded in cultures around the world.\n\nAll true tea comes from the same plant species, Camellia sinensis. The differences between green, black, white, and oolong tea lie in how the leaves are processed after harvesting. Green tea leaves are quickly heated to prevent oxidation, preserving their colour and delicate flavour. Black tea leaves are fully oxidized, giving them their dark colour and robust taste. Oolong tea is partially oxidized, falling somewhere between green and black.\n\nTea played a surprising role in world history. The British love of tea, combined with trade imbalances with China, led to the Opium Wars in the 19th century. The Boston Tea Party of 1773, when American colonists threw tea into the harbour to protest British taxes, became a pivotal event in the American Revolution. Today, India and China are the world's largest tea producers, together accounting for over 60% of global production.\n\nModern research has revealed numerous health benefits associated with tea. The antioxidants in tea, particularly green tea, may reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers. Tea also contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation without drowsiness. However, tea also contains caffeine, so moderation is advised, especially for those sensitive to its effects.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Dolphins are among the most intelligent and beloved animals on Earth. These marine mammals belong to the cetacean family, which also includes whales and porpoises. With their permanent smiles and playful behaviour, dolphins have captured human imagination for thousands of years. Ancient Greeks considered them sacred and depicted them in art and mythology.\n\nDolphin intelligence rivals that of great apes. They can recognize themselves in mirrors, a test of self-awareness that few animals pass. Dolphins have been observed using tools, such as sponges to protect their snouts while foraging on the ocean floor. They have complex social structures and communicate through a sophisticated system of clicks, whistles, and body language. Remarkably, each dolphin develops its own unique whistle, essentially a name that other dolphins use to call them.\n\nDolphins are also known for their echolocation abilities. They produce clicking sounds that bounce off objects and return as echoes, allowing them to 'see' their surroundings through sound. This biological sonar is so precise that dolphins can detect objects as small as a coin from 70 metres away. Echolocation helps dolphins navigate murky waters and locate prey.\n\nThe relationship between humans and dolphins has been mutually beneficial in many ways. Dolphins have been trained to assist in search and rescue operations and have been observed helping drowning swimmers. In some parts of the world, dolphins cooperate with fishermen, driving fish into nets and receiving a share of the catch. Conservation efforts aim to protect dolphins from threats including pollution, fishing nets, and habitat destruction.",

      "passage": "The Pyramids of Egypt stand as enduring symbols of ancient civilization's remarkable achievements. Built as tombs for pharaohs and their queens, these massive structures have survived for over 4,500 years. The most famous are the pyramids at Giza, including the Great Pyramid of Khufu, which was the tallest human-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.\n\nThe construction of the pyramids remains one of history's greatest mysteries. The Great Pyramid contains an estimated 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons, with some weighing as much as 80 tons. How ancient Egyptians transported and lifted these massive stones without modern machinery continues to puzzle researchers. Theories include ramps, levers, and even the use of water to reduce friction.\n\nThe pyramids were not built by slaves, as many people believe. Archaeological evidence suggests they were constructed by paid workers who lived in nearby villages. These workers were well-fed and received medical care. Building a pyramid was considered a great honour, and workers' tombs have been found near the pyramids, indicating their respected status.\n\nInside the pyramids, elaborate chambers and passageways were built to protect the pharaoh's mummified body and the treasures buried with them for the afterlife. Unfortunately, most pyramids were robbed in ancient times. Only the tomb of Tutankhamun, discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter, was found largely intact, revealing the incredible wealth buried with Egyptian royalty. Today, the pyramids remain one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.",

      "source": "Additional Comprehension",
      "passage": "Rainbows are one of nature's most beautiful optical phenomena, appearing when sunlight interacts with water droplets in the atmosphere. The science behind rainbows was first explained by Isaac Newton in the 17th century when he demonstrated that white light is actually composed of a spectrum of colours. When light enters a water droplet, it slows down and bends—a process called refraction.\n\nInside the droplet, light reflects off the back surface and exits, bending again as it leaves. Because different colours of light bend at slightly different angles, they separate into the familiar bands of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The order of colours in a rainbow is always the same, with red on the outer edge and violet on the inner edge.\n\nRainbows are actually full circles, but we typically see only an arc because the horizon blocks the lower portion. From an airplane or high mountain, it's sometimes possible to see a complete circular rainbow. Double rainbows occur when light reflects twice inside water droplets, creating a second, fainter arc with reversed colours. The dark band between the two rainbows is called Alexander's band, named after the ancient Greek philosopher who first described it.\n\nRainbows have inspired countless myths and legends across cultures. In Norse mythology, the rainbow bridge Bifrost connected Earth to the realm of the gods. Many cultures considered rainbows as signs of hope or divine promises. In Ireland, leprechauns are said to hide their gold at the rainbow's end—though since a rainbow is an optical illusion with no fixed location, that treasure would be impossible to find!",

      "passage": "The Internet has transformed nearly every aspect of modern life, yet most people are unaware of its fascinating origins. The Internet began as a military project during the Cold War. In 1969, the United States Department of Defense created ARPANET, a network designed to maintain communications even if parts were destroyed in a nuclear attack. The first message sent over ARPANET was 'LO'—the system crashed before 'LOGIN' could be completed.\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, the network grew as universities and research institutions joined. The technology that would make the Internet accessible to everyone—the World Wide Web—was invented in 1989 by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, the European physics laboratory. Berners-Lee created HTML (the language for web pages), URLs (web addresses), and HTTP (the protocol for transferring data). He made his invention freely available to everyone.\n\nThe Internet exploded into mainstream use in the 1990s with the development of web browsers and commercial Internet service providers. In 1993, there were only about 130 websites; by 2000, there were over 17 million. Today, there are nearly 2 billion websites, and over 5 billion people—more than 60% of the world's population—use the Internet.\n\nThe Internet has revolutionised communication, commerce, education, and entertainment. Email replaced traditional letters for many purposes. Social media connected people across the globe. Online shopping transformed retail. However, the Internet has also raised concerns about privacy, security, misinformation, and addiction. As we navigate the digital age, society continues to grapple with both the incredible benefits and significant challenges that this technology presents.",

      "passage": "Trees are among the most important organisms on our planet, providing countless benefits that make life on Earth possible. Through photosynthesis, trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen—a single mature tree can produce enough oxygen for two people annually. Trees also act as carbon sinks, storing carbon that would otherwise contribute to climate change. The world's forests hold approximately 400 billion tons of carbon.\n\nBeyond their role in the carbon cycle, trees provide numerous ecological benefits. Their roots prevent soil erosion and filter water as it percolates into the ground. Trees create habitats for countless species of birds, insects, and mammals. In cities, trees reduce the urban heat island effect, lowering temperatures by providing shade and releasing water vapor through transpiration.\n\nHumans have depended on trees throughout history for food, medicine, shelter, and fuel. Many of our most important medicines, including aspirin (originally from willow bark) and the cancer drug Taxol (from Pacific yew trees), come from trees. Rubber, paper, and countless other products derive from trees. The timber industry provides livelihoods for millions of people worldwide.\n\nSadly, deforestation continues at an alarming rate. Approximately 10 million hectares of forest are lost each year—an area roughly the size of South Korea. The main drivers are agriculture, logging, and urban expansion. Reforestation efforts are underway worldwide, but protecting existing forests remains crucial. When we protect trees, we protect our own future, for as the saying goes, 'The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second-best time is now.'",
