      "title": "The Miser and His Gold",
      "passage": "Once there was a miser who sold all his possessions and, with the money, bought a great lump of gold, dug a deep hole at the edge of the garden, and there he buried his gold. Once a day, thereafter, the miser went to the garden, dug up his gold, and embraced it lovingly. One of the miser's workmen wondered why his master spent so much time in the garden. One day, he hid behind a tree and soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure. That night, when the miser was fast asleep, the workman crept into the garden and stole the lump of gold. When the miser found that his gold was gone, he tore his hair and cried aloud in his despair. A neighbour came running to see what the matter was, and the grief-stricken miser told him what had happened. Then the neighbour said, \"Pray stop your weeping. Go and find a stone. Place the stone in the hole and imagine that it is your lump of gold. The stone will serve your purpose, for you never meant to use the gold anyway. It makes little difference whether it is gold or stone if you are never going to use it.\"",

It soon gathered speed and rushed on through the night.\n\nMy companions opened large tiffin carriers and settled down to their meal. But the baby's cries became howls and the grandmother hung a saree from the chain on the side wall of the carriage. She put the baby in this cradle and the baby stopped crying almost at once.\n\nAt the same time, the train came to a halt. There was a great commotion. I looked out of the window and found that a large crowd had gathered outside and everyone was asking who had pulled the chain. Suddenly I saw that the grandmother had hung the cradle on the alarm chain!",

      "title": "Homesickness by Roald Dahl",
      "passage": "I was homesick during the whole of my first term at St Peter's. Homesickness is a bit like seasickness. You don't know how awful it is till you get it, and when you do, it hits you right in the top of the stomach and you want to die. The only comfort is that both homesickness and seasickness are instantly curable. The first goes away the moment you walk out of the school grounds and the second is forgotten as soon as the ship enters port.\n\nI was so terribly homesick during my first two weeks that I set about making a plan for getting myself sent back home, even if it were for only a few days. My idea was that I should all of a sudden develop an attack of acute appendicitis.\n\nYou will probably think it silly that a nine-year old boy imagined that he could get away with a trick like that, but I had sound reasons for trying it. Only a month before, my elder sister had actually had appendicitis, and for several days before her operation I was able to observe her behavior at close quarters. I noticed that the thing she complained about the most was a severe pain down in the lower right side of her tummy. As well as this, she kept being sick and refused to eat and ran a temperature.\n\nYou might, by the way, be interested that this sister had her appendix removed not in a fine hospital operating-room full of bright lights and gowned nurses, but on our own nursery table at home by the local doctor and his anesthetist. In those days it was fairly common practice for a doctor to arrive at your house with a bag of instruments, then drape a clean sheet over the most convenient table and get on with it.\n\nOn this occasion, I can remember lurking in the corridor outside the nursery while the operation was going on. My other sisters were with me, and we stood spellbound, listening to the soft medical murmurs coming from behind the locked door.\n\nThe next day we were allowed to inspect the appendix itself in a glass bottle. It was a longish black wormy-looking thing, and I said, \"Do I have one of those inside me, Nanny?\"\n\"Everybody has one,\" Nanny answered.\n\"What's it for?\" I asked her.\n\"God works in mysterious ways,\" she said, which was her stock reply whenever she did not know the answer.\n\"What makes it go bad?\" I asked her.\n\"Toothbrush bristles,\" she answered, this time with no hesitation at all. \"Whenever a bristle comes out of your toothbrush and you swallow it, it sticks to your appendix and turns it rotten,\" she added.\n\nAs I went upstairs and knocked on the brown door after breakfast, I did not even feel frightened of the Matron.\n\"Come in!\" boomed the voice. I entered the room clutching my stomach on the right-hand side and staggered pathetically.\n\"What's the matter with you?\" the Matron shouted. \"It hurts, Matron,\" I moaned. \"Oh, it hurts so much! Just here!\"",

      "title": "Environmental Pollution",
      "passage": "The introduction of harmful waste materials that are hazardous to life, the natural world and our activities, is commonly known as pollution. Pollution has harmful effects on the ecosystem. It disturbs the balance of the biosphere in which living beings survive. This imbalance of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon and water vapour causes discomfort to all living organisms on the planet. It depletes the ozone layer over the earth that defends us from the damaging ultraviolet rays of the sun. The major types of environmental pollution are air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, thermal pollution, soil pollution and light pollution. Environmental pollution is caused by deforestation and hazardous gaseous emissions.\n\nAir pollution is caused by the smoke emitted by cars, buses, trucks, trains and factories. This is known to cause lung cancer, asthma, allergies, and various skin and breathing problems along with severe and irreparable damage to flora and fauna. Water pollution is caused when industrial waste products are released into lakes, rivers, and other water bodies. This is destructive for the marine ecosystem. Noise pollution is caused by loud noises from aircrafts, cars, buses and trucks, vehicle horns, loudspeakers and noise from factories.\n\nSoil pollution is a result of acid rain, polluted water, fertilizers, etc. In short, this occurs when chemicals are released into the soil. Light pollution includes use of excess lighting equipment. The excessive and inappropriate use of artificial light causes several phenomena that decrease visibility and cause severe visual discomfort. Light pollution is a great hindrance to astronomy as it has become increasingly difficult to view the night sky because of interference from artificial light. The last decade has witnessed an alarming rise in environmental pollution. This problem is even more alarming as this has caused irreparable damage to the earth.",
