      "source": "Sample Paper 1",
      "passage": "Once there was a miser who sold all his possessions and, with the money, bought a great lump of gold, dug a deep hole at the edge of the garden, and there he buried his gold. Once a day, thereafter, the miser went to the garden, dug up his gold, and embraced it lovingly. One of the miser's workmen wondered why his master spent so much time in the garden. One day, he hid behind a tree and soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure. That night, when the miser was fast asleep, the workman crept into the garden and stole the lump of gold. When the miser found that his gold was gone, he tore his hair and cried aloud in his despair. A neighbour came running to see what the matter was, and the grief-stricken miser told him what had happened. Then the neighbour said, \"Pray stop your weeping. Go and find a stone. Place the stone in the hole and imagine that it is your lump of gold. The stone will serve your purpose, for you never meant to use the gold anyway. It makes little difference whether it is gold or stone if you are never going to use it.\"",

I looked out of the window and found that a large crowd had gathered outside and everyone was asking who had pulled the chain.

      "title": "Homesickness by Roald Dahl",
      "source": "Sample Paper 4",
      "passage": "I was homesick during the whole of my first term at St Peter's. Homesickness is a bit like seasickness. You don't know how awful it is till you get it, and when you do, it hits you right in the top of the stomach and you want to die. The only comfort is that both homesickness and seasickness are instantly curable. The first goes away the moment you walk out of the school grounds and the second is forgotten as soon as the ship enters port.\n\nI was so terribly homesick during my first two weeks that I set about making a plan for getting myself sent back home, even if it were for only a few days. My idea was that I should all of a sudden develop an attack of acute appendicitis.\n\nYou will probably think it silly that a nine-year old boy imagined that he could get away with a trick like that, but I had sound reasons for trying it. Only a month before, my elder sister had actually had appendicitis, and for several days before her operation I was able to observe her behavior at close quarters. I noticed that the thing she complained about the most was a severe pain down in the lower right side of her tummy. As well as this, she kept being sick and refused to eat and ran a temperature.\n\nYou might, by the way, be interested that this sister had her appendix removed not in a fine hospital operating-room full of bright lights and gowned nurses, but on our own nursery table at home by the local doctor and his anesthetist. In those days it was fairly common practice for a doctor to arrive at your house with a bag of instruments, then drape a clean sheet over the most convenient table and get on with it.\n\nOn this occasion, I can remember lurking in the corridor outside the nursery while the operation was going on. My other sisters were with me, and we stood spellbound, listening to the soft medical murmurs coming from behind the locked door.\n\nThe next day we were allowed to inspect the appendix itself in a glass bottle. It was a longish black wormy-looking thing, and I said, \"Do I have one of those inside me, Nanny?\"\n\"Everybody has one,\" Nanny answered.\n\"What's it for?\" I asked her.\n\"God works in mysterious ways,\" she said, which was her stock reply whenever she did not know the answer.\n\"What makes it go bad?\" I asked her.\n\"Toothbrush bristles,\" she answered, this time with no hesitation at all. \"Whenever a bristle comes out of your toothbrush and you swallow it, it sticks to your appendix and turns it rotten,\" she added.\n\nAs I went upstairs and knocked on the brown door after breakfast, I did not even feel frightened of the Matron.\n\"Come in!\" boomed the voice. I entered the room clutching my stomach on the right-hand side and staggered pathetically.\n\"What's the matter with you?\" the Matron shouted. \"It hurts, Matron,\" I moaned. \"Oh, it hurts so much! Just here!\"",

      "passage": "The introduction of harmful waste materials that are hazardous to life, the natural world and our activities, is commonly known as pollution. Pollution has harmful effects on the ecosystem. It disturbs the balance of the biosphere in which living beings survive. This imbalance of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon and water vapour causes discomfort to all living organisms on the planet. It depletes the ozone layer over the earth that defends us from the damaging ultraviolet rays of the sun. The major types of environmental pollution are air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, thermal pollution, soil pollution and light pollution. Environmental pollution is caused by deforestation and hazardous gaseous emissions.\n\nAir pollution is caused by the smoke emitted by cars, buses, trucks, trains and factories. This is known to cause lung cancer, asthma, allergies, and various skin and breathing problems along with severe and irreparable damage to flora and fauna. Water pollution is caused when industrial waste products are released into lakes, rivers, and other water bodies. This is destructive for the marine ecosystem. Noise pollution is caused by loud noises from aircrafts, cars, buses and trucks, vehicle horns, loudspeakers and noise from factories.\n\nSoil pollution is a result of acid rain, polluted water, fertilizers, etc. In short, this occurs when chemicals are released into the soil. Light pollution includes use of excess lighting equipment. The excessive and inappropriate use of artificial light causes several phenomena that decrease visibility and cause severe visual discomfort. Light pollution is a great hindrance to astronomy as it has become increasingly difficult to view the night sky because of interference from artificial light. The last decade has witnessed an alarming rise in environmental pollution. This problem is even more alarming as this has caused irreparable damage to the earth.",

      "passage": "Everyone has a favourite attraction at an amusement park, and I am no different. However, unlike most people who seem to prefer roller coasters, my favourite ride is a little more gentle. Every time I go to a fair or an amusement park, I absolutely have to ride the Ferris wheel.\n\nThe Ferris wheel is simple and yet also quite complex. That is, riding it is easy, but how it works is complicated. A series of carts are attached to a wheel, which is attached to a rim. That rim rotates vertically around an axis, and gravity keeps the carts upright. As simple as the ride seems, only advanced engineers can make safe and fun Ferris wheels.\n\nWhile the Ferris wheel is not as thrilling as a roller coaster, it is still very exciting. The fact of being high in the air makes it so much more entertaining than a lot of rides. I mean, how often do you hang from that high up in daily life?\n\nNevertheless, I have to admit, I don't seek out Ferris wheels because of their excitement. Rather, I find them very relaxing. At the top of the Ferris wheel, you get beautiful sights of the park. You also get a sense of calm that you don't get in the hustle and bustle of the park below.\n\nAdditionally, Ferris wheels are also gorgeous to look at when they are lit up at night. In fact, the original Ferris wheel was designed as much to be seen as to be ridden.\n\nThe first Ferris wheel was made by and named after George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr. He designed it for the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. It was the tallest attraction there, standing 264 feet high.\n\nHowever visitors to the fair were impressed by the size of the ride as well as the mechanics of it. In 1893, anything that was not turned by hand was considered a sight to see. And the wheel, which was a machine, was truly incredible to see. Further, as one visitor put it, the wheel was amazing because it seemed to be missing support. That is, it did not look like it could stand on its own. And yet it did and even rotated.\n\nFerris wheel technology has only improved since then. Most of today's Ferris wheels are much larger than the first one. The largest in the world is the \"Singapore Flyer,\" which stands slightly taller than twice what Ferris's did.\n\nToday, the Ferris wheel is the most common amusement park ride. But that does not mean you should take them for granted. Instead, be thankful for Ferris' invention. The next time you're at an amusement park, don't just look up at the impressive wheel in the sky on your way to a newer attraction. Take it for a spin!",

      "title": "Earthquakes: Movement of the Earth's Crust",
      "source": "Sample Paper 7",
      "passage": "Earthquakes are the shaking and moving of the ground when energy is released in waves. These waves are called seismic waves. These waves are similar to ocean waves, which move through water. Seismic waves, however, move through the ground.\n\nMost earthquakes are caused by the movement of large sections of the Earth's crust, called plates. The place where two plates meet is called a fault. Faults look like large cracks in the ground. If the two plates move in different directions, they build up energy at the fault line. When enough energy builds up, the stress on the fault becomes too great and it ruptures. This releases the energy and the ground starts to shake.\n\nEarthquakes can also be caused by other natural events, such as landslides and volcanoes. Manmade earthquakes happen because of nuclear testing and mining explosions.\n\nThe first movement of an earthquake, called the main shock, is often followed by smaller ground trembles, called aftershocks. These aftershocks are the plates settling into their new position. Aftershocks can continue for days after the main shock.\n\nThere are an estimated 500,000 earthquakes around the world each year. Most are so mild they are only recorded on scientific instruments. Only about 100,000 can be felt by humans. Of these, only about 19 a year cause major damage.\n\nMajor earthquakes in populated areas can cause huge destruction. Buildings collapse, roads and bridges buckle and crack, and electrical and gas lines break and cause fires. If the earthquake happens in the ocean, it makes a series of huge ocean waves called a tsunami. The tsunami travels until it finally reaches land, where it causes large flooding.\n\nScientists are searching for ways to predict earthquakes. They study the historical patterns of earthquakes and monitor the movement of the plates with seismic equipment. While they cannot predict an exact date of a future earthquake, they have a better understanding of when earthquakes are more likely to happen.",

      "passage": "Nepal, a small, mountainous country tucked between India and China, may seem completely foreign to many Americans. Cows walk down busy streets unharmed, 24 different languages are spoken, and people eat two meals of rice and lentils every day. Nepali holidays, many of which are related to the Hindu religion, can seem especially bizarre to Americans unfamiliar with the culture. However, if we look beyond how others celebrate to consider the things they are celebrating, we find surprising similarities to our own culture.\n\nThe biggest holiday in Nepal is Dashain, a ten-day festival for the Hindu goddess Durga that takes place in September or October. According to Hindu beliefs, Durga defeated the evil demons of the world. To thank the goddess, people visit temples in her honour and sacrifice goats or sheep as offerings. Throughout the year, most Nepalis do not eat much meat because it is expensive, but Dashain is a time to enjoy meat every day. Children fly colourful, homemade kites during Dashain. People also construct enormous bamboo swings on street corners and in parks. Every evening people gather at these swings and take turns swinging. Nepalis say that by swinging, people can relieve the earth of their weight, if only for a few minutes out of the year. Dashain is a time for people to eat good food, relax, and enjoy themselves!\n\nAside from eating and enjoying themselves, during Dashain, people also receive blessings from their elders. Schools and offices shut down so people can travel to be with their families. Reuniting with family reminds people of the importance of kindness, respect, and forgiveness. People also clean and decorate their homes for Dashain. And, like many holidays in the United States, it is a time for shopping. Children and adults alike get new clothes for the occasion. People express appreciation for all that they have, while looking forward to good fortune and peace in the year to come.\n\nDuring American holidays, people may not sacrifice goats or soar on bamboo swings, but we do often travel to be with family members and take time off work or school to relax. No matter how we celebrate, many people around the world spend their holidays honouring family, reflecting on their blessings, and hoping for good fortune in the future.",
