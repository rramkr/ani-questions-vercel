      "question": "What is a simple sentence? Give an example.",

      "question": "How do you change an assertive sentence to interrogative?",
      "answer": "To change assertive to interrogative: Use helping verbs (is, are, do, does, can, will) at the beginning. A positive assertive often becomes a negative interrogative. Example: 'He is honest' becomes 'Isn't he honest?' or 'Is he not honest?'",

      "question": "Differentiate between compound sentence and complex sentence.",
      "answer": "A compound sentence joins clauses of equal importance using coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so). A complex sentence has one main clause and one or more subordinate clauses joined by subordinating conjunctions (because, when, although). Compound = equal clauses; Complex = unequal clauses.",
