    {
      "id": "sa001",
      "question": "What is active voice? Give an example.",
      "answer": "Active voice is when the subject of a sentence performs the action indicated by the verb. The subject is the doer of the action. For example, 'Ria reads the newspaper' - here Ria (subject) performs the action of reading.",
      "key_points": ["subject performs action", "subject is doer", "example with subject doing action"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa002",
      "question": "What is passive voice? Give an example.",
      "answer": "Passive voice is when the subject of a sentence receives the action rather than performing it. The subject is acted upon. For example, 'The newspaper is read by Ria' - here the newspaper (subject) receives the action of reading.",
      "key_points": ["subject receives action", "subject is acted upon", "example with subject receiving action"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa003",
      "question": "What is the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs in relation to voice?",
      "answer": "Transitive verbs have objects and can be changed from active to passive voice. Intransitive verbs do not have objects and cannot be changed to passive voice. For example, 'She writes letters' (transitive) can become passive, but 'She sleeps' (intransitive) cannot.",
      "key_points": ["transitive has object", "transitive can be passive", "intransitive no object", "intransitive cannot be passive"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa004",
      "question": "How do you change a simple present tense sentence from active to passive voice?",
      "answer": "To change simple present from active to passive: make the object the new subject, use is/am/are + past participle (V3), and add 'by + original subject' as the agent. Example: 'She writes letters' becomes 'Letters are written by her'.",
      "key_points": ["object becomes subject", "is/am/are + V3", "by + agent"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa005",
      "question": "How do you change a simple past tense sentence from active to passive voice?",
      "answer": "To change simple past from active to passive: make the object the new subject, use was/were + past participle (V3), and add 'by + original subject'. Example: 'She wrote a letter' becomes 'A letter was written by her'.",
      "key_points": ["object becomes subject", "was/were + V3", "by + agent"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa006",
      "question": "How do you change a simple future tense sentence from active to passive voice?",
      "answer": "To change simple future from active to passive: make the object the new subject, use will/shall + be + past participle (V3), and add 'by + original subject'. Example: 'She will write a letter' becomes 'A letter will be written by her'.",
      "key_points": ["object becomes subject", "will/shall + be + V3", "by + agent"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa007",
      "question": "What is the passive voice formula for present continuous tense?",
      "answer": "For present continuous passive, we use: is/am/are + being + past participle (V3). Example: 'She is writing a letter' becomes 'A letter is being written by her'. The structure shows ongoing action in passive form.",
      "key_points": ["is/am/are + being + V3", "shows ongoing action", "example given"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa008",
      "question": "What is the passive voice formula for present perfect tense?",
      "answer": "For present perfect passive, we use: has/have + been + past participle (V3). Example: 'She has written a letter' becomes 'A letter has been written by her'. This shows completed action with present relevance.",
      "key_points": ["has/have + been + V3", "completed action", "example given"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa009",
      "question": "What happens to the object and subject when changing from active to passive voice?",
      "answer": "When changing from active to passive voice, the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence. The subject of the active sentence becomes the agent, introduced by 'by' at the end of the passive sentence.",
      "key_points": ["object becomes subject", "subject becomes agent", "agent introduced by 'by'"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa010",
      "question": "When can we omit 'by + agent' in passive voice?",
      "answer": "We can omit 'by + agent' in passive voice when the agent is unknown, unimportant, or obvious from context. For example, 'My wallet was stolen' (agent unknown), 'English is spoken here' (general/obvious agent).",
      "key_points": ["agent unknown", "agent unimportant", "agent obvious from context"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa011",
      "question": "How do you form passive voice with modal verbs?",
      "answer": "With modal verbs (can, may, must, should, etc.), passive voice is formed using: modal + be + past participle (V3). Example: 'She can write a letter' becomes 'A letter can be written by her'. The modal remains unchanged.",
      "key_points": ["modal + be + V3", "modal unchanged", "example given"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa012",
      "question": "What is the passive voice formula for past continuous tense?",
      "answer": "For past continuous passive, we use: was/were + being + past participle (V3). Example: 'She was writing a letter' becomes 'A letter was being written by her'. This shows an ongoing action in the past.",
      "key_points": ["was/were + being + V3", "ongoing past action", "example given"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa013",
      "question": "What is the passive voice formula for past perfect tense?",
      "answer": "For past perfect passive, we use: had + been + past participle (V3). Example: 'She had written a letter' becomes 'A letter had been written by her'. This shows an action completed before another past action.",
      "key_points": ["had + been + V3", "action before another past action", "example given"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa014",
      "question": "What is the passive voice formula for future perfect tense?",
      "answer": "For future perfect passive, we use: will/shall + have + been + past participle (V3). Example: 'She will have written a letter' becomes 'A letter will have been written by her'. This shows action that will be completed by a future time.",
      "key_points": ["will/shall + have + been + V3", "completed by future time", "example given"]
    },
    {
      "id": "sa015",
      "question": "Why is it important to know the three forms of verbs (V1, V2, V3) for voice conversion?",
      "answer": "Knowing the three forms is essential because passive voice always uses the third form (past participle/V3). V1 is the base form, V2 is past tense, and V3 is past participle. Without knowing V3, you cannot correctly form passive sentences.",
      "key_points": ["passive uses V3", "V1 base form", "V2 past tense", "V3 past participle"]
