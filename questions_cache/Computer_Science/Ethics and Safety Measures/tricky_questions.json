      "answer": "No, Priya is NOT correct. This is a weak password.\n\nReasons:\n1. It uses her name - easily guessable\n2. It uses her birth year - also easily guessable\n3. It only has 9 characters (should be 8-10, but lacks complexity)\n4. No special characters\n5. No uppercase letters (other than first letter)\n\nA strong password should:\n- Not contain personal information\n- Have uppercase and lowercase letters\n- Include digits and special characters\n- Example: Pr!y@2#Str0ng",

      "question": "Amit installed an antivirus on his computer last year. He thinks his computer is now permanently protected. Is he right? Why or why not?",
      "answer": "No, Amit is NOT right. His computer is NOT permanently protected.\n\nReasons:\n1. New viruses and malware are created every day\n2. Antivirus needs regular updates to recognize new threats\n3. Old antivirus versions cannot detect newer malware\n4. He should update his antivirus regularly\n5. Operating system also needs to be updated for security patches\n\nAntivirus software must be updated frequently to provide effective protection.",

      "answer": "No, Sneha should NOT open this file. This is likely malware.\n\nRed flags:\n1. The file has double extension (.mp4.exe)\n2. The real extension is .exe (executable program), not a video\n3. Attackers often disguise malware as harmless files\n4. Opening it could install viruses, spyware, or other malware\n\nSneha should:\n1. Delete the file immediately\n2. Never open files with suspicious extensions\n3. Run antivirus scan if she already opened it\n4. Be cautious even with files from friends (their account could be hacked)",

      "answer": "No, his friend's reasoning is NOT valid. This is software piracy.\n\nWhy it's wrong:\n1. 'Everyone does it' doesn't make it legal or ethical\n2. Software piracy is illegal regardless of how common it is\n3. It violates copyright and intellectual property rights\n4. Pirated software may contain malware\n5. It harms the developers who created the software\n\nRohan should refuse and suggest buying licensed copies or using free alternatives.",

      "answer": "No, this website is NOT safe. This is a phishing website.\n\nRed flags:\n1. The URL uses '0' (zero) instead of 'o' - common trick\n2. Real Amazon's URL is 'amazon.com', not 'amaz0n-login.com'\n3. Phishers create fake websites that look authentic\n4. Even https:// and padlock can be on fake sites\n\nAlways:\n1. Check the URL carefully for spelling tricks\n2. Type the website address directly instead of clicking links\n3. Verify the domain name matches the real company\n4. Be suspicious of login pages from email links",

      "question": "Meera thinks that if she deletes her social media posts, they disappear forever. Is she correct? Relate this to digital footprint.",
      "answer": "No, Meera is NOT correct.\n\nExplanation:\n1. Digital footprint includes all traces of online activity\n2. Even deleted posts may exist in backups, screenshots, or archives\n3. Others may have shared or saved her posts before deletion\n4. Internet archives and cached versions may retain content\n5. 'Whatever you do online persists and establishes your online identity'\n\nLessons:\n1. Think before posting anything online\n2.

      "answer": "No, Sonia is NOT right. This is a dangerous practice.\n\nRisks:\n1. If one account is hacked, all accounts are compromised\n2. Data breaches on one site expose all her accounts\n3. Hackers specifically try leaked passwords on multiple sites\n4. Financial accounts become vulnerable through social media hacks\n\nBetter approach:\n1. Use different passwords for different accounts\n2. Use a password manager to remember them\n3. At minimum, use unique passwords for banking and email\n4.

      "question": "Vinod thinks that using 'incognito mode' or 'private browsing' makes him completely anonymous online. Is he correct?",
      "answer": "No, Vinod is NOT completely correct.\n\nWhat incognito mode DOES:\n1. Doesn't save browsing history on your device\n2. Doesn't save cookies after closing the session\n3. Provides privacy from others using the same device\n\nWhat incognito mode DOESN'T DO:\n1. Hide your IP address from websites\n2. Make you invisible to your Internet Service Provider\n3. Prevent websites from tracking your session\n4. Protect from malware or phishing\n\nFor sensitive information, incognito mode is helpful but not a complete anonymity solution.",

      "question": "A person invented a new machine and wants to protect it. Should they apply for copyright or patent? Explain.",
      "answer": "They should apply for a Patent, NOT copyright.\n\nReason:\n- Patent protects inventions (machines, processes, products)\n- Copyright protects creative works (books, music, software, art)\n\nPatent benefits:\n1. Gives sole right to make, use, and sell the invention\n2. Protects the invention for a set period of time\n3. Others cannot copy or manufacture the machine without permission\n\nCopyright would not protect a machine because it's an invention, not a creative work like writing or music.",

      "answer": "Pooja likely installed software bundled with Adware and possibly Spyware.\n\nWhat happened:\n1. Free software from unknown sources often contains adware\n2. Adware places advertisements and pop-ups in the browser\n3. Adware slows down the computer\n4. Spyware may also be installed to track her activities\n\nWhat Pooja should do:\n1. Install and run anti-adware and anti-spyware programs\n2. Run a full antivirus scan\n3. Uninstall the suspicious software\n4. In future, download software only from trusted/official sources\n5.
